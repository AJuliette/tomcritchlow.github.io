Hi there!

I've spent my life curious about technology, art, games, people, writing and mathematics. Somewhere in a 4-dimensional intersection of those things I've arrived at where I am today.

I'm from the UK originally and now live in Brooklyn, NY. 

I'm building a small marketing & innovation consulting agency. I've been working in technology, product and marketing for a decade and have worked with and for companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, The New York Times, Hipmunk and more.

Playing in the intersection between art, design, technology, offline and online I'm building a local business helping Brooklyn-based artists and makers connect to interesting projects:

Just get in touch. I'm always happy to meet for coffee. Email is here: [tjcritchlow@gmail.com](mailto:tjcritchlow@gmail.com)

Much love.
