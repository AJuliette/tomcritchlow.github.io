  <h2>Read Our Full Guide to Sending Money to China</h2>
  <p>If you’ve landed on this page, chances are you’re looking for information on how to send money to China. Whether you’re sending money to friends or family or sorting out your financial affairs in China, the last thing you want to have to deal with is navigating a potentially complicated and expensive process.</p>
  <p>Sending money from the United States to China doesn’t have to be expensive. Compare the transfer fees and exchange rates of the many options available to you to get the best deal. From bank transfers and online transactions to options that allow recipients to collect your funds within minutes, sending an international money transfer to China is easy. However, do your research and shop around for the best available deal.</p>


<p>When you send money overseas you will usually have to register for an account with a money transfer provider. The process for doing this varies between companies but will generally require you to provide your name, address, phone number, email address and proof of identity. If you are not using cash for this transaction, you will need to provide your banking info in order to have funds drafted from your account.</p>

<p>Once you’ve selected your payment option and entered the full details of your transfer, you can make your transaction and wait for your funds to arrive. You’ll most likely be given a reference number or receipt, which you can use to check the progress of your transfer.</p>

<p>Sending money to China is fast, easy and convenient. Just make sure that you compare the range of transfer options available to you before deciding on the one you’d like to use.</p>

<h3>How do international money transfers work?</h3>
<p>An international money transfer allows you to send money to a recipient overseas. Generally, a transfer involves you providing funds to a bank or an independent transfer provider, which then sends the money to your recipient in another country — in this case, China. This can be done in person or oftentimes online. You can use cash or transfer funds from your bank account, which will then either be deposited into your recipient’s bank account are made available as cash for them to pick up at a location in their country.</p>

<h3>Banks versus money transfer companies</h3>
<p>As China’s economy has experienced a boom in recent decades, the Chinese yuan has become increasingly popular among traders on the global currency market. Many major American banks offer the option of sending funds to China, but banks typically charge high transfer fees and offer exchange rates that are significantly lower than the mid-market rate.</p>

<p>Money transfer providers offer better exchange rates than many banks and also charge lower fees, leading to more affordable transactions. This means that you save money, and your recipient ends up with more Chinese yuans in their pocket.</p>

<h3>Case Study: Henry sends money to China</h3>
<p>Henry has waved goodbye to his parents in China and settled in the United States. However, he’d like to send his family $1,000 as a gift to thank them for the financial support they provided during his education. In an attempt to get the best available deal, Henry decides to compare what two separate online money transfer providers charge for the same transaction.</p>

<h3>Emergency cash transfers in China</h3>
<p>When you need to send funds quickly, you’ll often have to pay an extra fee or receive a lower exchange rate in order to get your funds processed as quickly as possible. With this in mind, it’s important that you check the details of your transfer before you send it to ensure you know exactly how much you are spending.</p>

<h3>Receiving cash in China</h3>
<p>Western Union, MoneyGram and Ria provide the three largest money transfer networks in the world, with thousands of agent locations around the globe. You’ll need to pass your transaction reference number on to your recipient to allow them to pick up the funds. They’ll also need to bring along a photo ID.</p>

<h3>TIPS FOR PICKING UP CASH</h3>
<p>Although China is considered a safe country for American tourists, you should exercise caution when picking up cash from an agent location. Don’t advertise the fact that you have a wallet full of cash, and head to your bank as soon as possible to deposit the funds.</p>
