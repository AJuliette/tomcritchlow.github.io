            <p>A few interesting strategy roles for media companies have come across my feeds recently so I thought I’d post them all in one place in case anyone is looking.</p>

            <h2 id="senior-strategist-quartz-creative">Senior Strategist, Quartz Creative</h2>

            <p><a href="http://atlanticmedia.jazz.co/apply/vgH8ckfgpb/Senior-Strategist-Quartz-Creative">link</a></p>

            <blockquote>
            <p>Quartz Creative is the in-house creative shop at Quartz. We help brands make interesting and effective “things” for people, designed for the ways they live and experience media. We’re part of the Quartz family (qz.com, Daily Brief, Quartz App, Quartz AI, Quartz Bot Studio). We put the user at the center of our thinking, and our work.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <blockquote>
            <p>We are looking for a high-energy, fast-paced creative and strategic doer to help guide our clients into new spaces and big ideas. We want a curious mind who researches like an academic and writes like a screenwriter. Equal parts analytical and imaginative, with a nose for insights that can inspire creative opportunities, and a storyteller’s instinct for delivery.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2 id="newsroom-strategy-editors-new-york-times">Newsroom Strategy Editors, New York Times</h2>

            <blockquote>
            <p>As a member of the team, you’ll serve as an advisor, problem solver and project manager in transformation efforts big and small. A few of the team’s current and upcoming projects include helping to develop new approaches to editing, reimagine the print newspaper and accelerate the expansion of visual journalism, among other elements of Dean and Joe’s recent action plan for the year ahead.</p>
            </blockquote>
