                Here‚Äôs why I think designing systems with tools/frameworks like Tachyons
                is a Good Idea‚Ñ¢.
              </p>
              <p class="fl w-100 w-50-l mh0 mt0 pr0 pr3-l measure lh-copy f5 f4-l">
                Design Systems break as they scale (either scaling org or
                scaling product) because new components/variants of a component
                are introduced.  Those variants sometimes (read: often) go
                undocumented, leading to duplication when that
                component/variant is needed (and created) again.  Even when the
                component is documented, documenting effectively often means
                dozens/hundreds of instances to capture all states/variants.
                Systems like Tachyons et al. approach this problem by instead
                documenting and limiting *properties* of components.  (I like
                to think of this as ‚Äúsubatomic‚Äù design.)
              </p>

                You then create
                components by composing subatomic components (properties).
                Rather than creating a component and its variants, you simply
                have a comprehensive list of ‚Äúingredient‚Äù subatomic components.
                Those subatomic components can be combined in thousands of ways
                to create hundreds of components.  The properties of those
                components are numerous, but constrained to a set of acceptable
                values (our subatomic components).‚Äù

                Tachyons is powerful, obvious, and well documented. It's made me rethink my approach to building organized and componentized CSS. I highly recommend you try it.
