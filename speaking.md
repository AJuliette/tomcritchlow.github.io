title: Conference Speaking
---

I love the opportunity to speak at conferences. If blogging is networked writing then conferences feel like networked conversations. I've been to incredible places around the world and met some wonderful people.

Notable conferences:
- MozCon Seattle head to head with Rand Fishkin 2012 ([link to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsVY10ubnZo))
- Distilled SearchLove San Diego 2017 ([link to slides](http://tomcritchlow.com/2017/02/24/the-state-of-media/))

If you're interested in having me speak at an event just drop me a note: tjcritchlow@gmail.com
