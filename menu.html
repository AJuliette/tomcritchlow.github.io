                          Have you had the feeling of being prey inside an algorithmic system?
  
  That system shock that comes from realizing that you’re no longer the user but the prey.
  
  Maybe this is common behaviour - but I recently clicked an Instagram ad (yes, I have a new watch - it’s very on brand for my blog).

  Here's my blog post on some stuff. Have you had the feeling of being prey inside an algorithmic system?
  
  That system shock that comes from realizing that you’re no longer the user but the prey.
  
  Maybe this is common behaviour - but I recently clicked an Instagram ad (yes, I have a new watch - it’s very on brand for my blog).
  
  I don’t click ads often, in fact I can’t remember the last time I did.
  
  But ever since clicking the watch ad my feed is populated exclusively by watch ads. So many watch ads. There’s an uneasy feeling of the algorithmic sharks circling in the water, they smell blood. A weakness in the user.
