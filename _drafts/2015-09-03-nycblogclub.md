title: You're Not Blogging, My Friend. And That's a Problem
subtitle: Week 1 of #NYCblogclub
---

I'm home after a long day's work consulting and the last thing I want to do is open up my laptop and write a blog post. But this week is week 1 of #NYCblogclub and so here we are.

Let's list some of the things blogging has done for me:

 - gained over a million dollars in revenue for Distilled
 - secured speaking slots at conferences
 - built lasting friendships
 - inspired healthy debates
 - helped me get hired at Google

You see the world has changed. The power structures we believe are at work ("your boss", "the system", "career paths") are all false idols. The modern  world is driven by networks and connections. Let's unpick how those work

So. Here we are. 

##Helping my friends blog

So I looked around and realized that I'm not blogging frequently, and neither are many of my close friends. 5 minutes later I had a Trello board live and sent out a call on Twitter and an email.

The result?

Me and 10 friends in a shared Trello board with the shared goal of publishing one post a week each for the next 12 weeks.

Of course, it's Thursday right now and I'm the first one to publish so we'll see how well this works. I'm going to be learning as I go about feedback loops and goal setting but one thing's for sure: we should all blog more.

A debt of gratidue is owed to Gary Chou for building wonderful feedback loops through his Orbital program. Read more about what he's up to in his post [Scaling Caring Through Networks](http://blog.garychou.com/post/126917792257/scaling-caring-through-networks)

##Blogging as connection

##Blogging as dialogue

##Blogging as career path

##Blogging as No Stack Startup

Many startups have started out of blogging. Some of my friends are "trying to build a startup" without just putting things out there in the world and seeing what sticks. It's surprising what will take off and what won't.

"I'm too busy to blog" is bullshit.



You're not blogging and that's a problem, my friend.
I'm too busy to blog. So why am I blogging?



Dear Gary,

I'm writing this blog post for you. It's an homage in a way. But also a reminder that the real lesson is that we should be fostering dialogue.
