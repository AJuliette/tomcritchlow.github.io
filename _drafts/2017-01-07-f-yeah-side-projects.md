title: The Importance of Launching
subtitle: Fuck yeah side projects!
---

This is the story of how a weekend project and 276 lines of Python got me a job at Google. But it's also a lesson I often tell - that side projects should be art, they should be interesting, don't obsess over business or growth - obsess over interesting, obsess over launched!

Let me tell you a story first.

## Act 1: Fuck Yeah Spotify



## Act 2: The Music Entrepreneur Applies for a Job at Google

When I was interviewing for a job at Google in 2012 the resume I wrote, at the bottom of the second page under "other skills" I wrote this:

"At the end of 2010 I started teaching myself how to code Python and have developed various applications on Googleâ€™s Appengine platform including www.7bks.com & fyspotify.appspot.com"

When I included this I was trying to demonstrate that I could code a little, I was trying to show a breadth of skills and suggest that I was more interesting than your average marketing geek.

You'd be surprised how many people pause at this question and struggle to think of an answer. Most people in fact will answer this question by talking about a project that they were a part of.

I'll say it again - a shockingly small number of people have built their own thing on the internet.

## Projects are currency in a networked world

## The Side Project Stress

## Objects not Projects






## Objects not Projects

It should be a thing, it needs no momentum.
