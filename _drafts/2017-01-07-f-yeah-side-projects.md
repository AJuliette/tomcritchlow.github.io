title: The Importance of Launching
subtitle: Fuck yeah side projects!
---

This is the story of how a weekend project and 276 lines of Python got me a job at Google. But it's also a lesson I often tell - that side projects should be art, they should be interesting and to be useful for your life they don't need to be businesses.

Let me tell you a story first.

## Act 1: Fuck Yeah Spotify

One rainy day in Seattle in 2011 I was looking out the window at the grey rian and searching for interestingness. Spotify hadn't yet launched in the US but it was looking increasingly likely that it would launch any day.

Having recently taught myself Python to build a books website, stitching APIs together was top of mind and I came up with the simple idea of aggregating the top tweeted Spotify albums every day.

The premise was pretty simple: use the topsy api to find the top spotify album URLs for the last 24 hours, run each of those through the Spotify API to get artist name and album title. Then run those through the Last.fm API to get album art.

It looked a little something like this:

And I launched it like this:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Boom! New coding project is now live: http://fyspotify.appspot.com showing the top tweeted spotify album from the last 24hrs. Auto-updating.</p>&mdash; Tom Critchlow (@tomcritchlow) <a href="https://twitter.com/tomcritchlow/status/50140995504971776">March 22, 2011</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I didn't then, and I don't now, know how to code Python very well and perhaps because of that, or because of the glitches in the topsy data it never actually returned the top tweeted albums. Instead it just collected some albums people had been tweeting about that day. Because of it's broken-ness I actually came to love it more. (I wrote about this a little in [random acts of algorithms](http://tomcritchlow.com/2014/12/03/random-acts-of-algorithms/))

## Act 2: The Music Entrepreneur Applies for a Job at Google

When I was interviewing for a job at Google in 2012 the resume I wrote, at the bottom of the second page under "other skills" I wrote this:

"At the end of 2010 I started teaching myself how to code Python and have developed various applications on Googleâ€™s Appengine platform including www.7bks.com & fyspotify.appspot.com"

When I included this I was trying to demonstrate that I could code a little, I was trying to show a breadth of skills and suggest that I was more interesting than your average marketing geek. Then, to my great surprise I proceeded to get asked in all 7 interviews about "my music startup" or "why I built a 

err.

Something had gone wrong I thought - 

## The Thing Is, Most People Haven't Launched Something on the Web

It's a massive differentiator to have launched something. To have had an idea, executed it. Beyond a Facebook post.

In interviews I'll always ask "name something that you've done that was 100% you - something you had the idea for and then made, doesn't matter how big or small". You'd be surprised how many people pause at this question and struggle to think of an answer. Most people in fact will answer this question by talking about a project that they were a part of.

I'll say it again - a shockingly small number of people have built their own thing on the internet.

## Projects are currency in a networked world

## The Side Project Stress







## Objects not Projects

It should be a thing, it needs no momentum.
