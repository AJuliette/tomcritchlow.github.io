title: Infrastructure & Architecture
---

After visiting the Canadian Centre for Architecture (which is stunning by the way) I've been exploring more and more around the topic of architecture. How fascinating the topic of constructing, designing, engineering and thinking about building the environments we live in?

We're all architects of our own lives to a greater or lesser degree but we can never escape the presence of an actual architect somewhere in our lives also. Here's some links I've found interesting:

>There was a crest of pyrotechnic sparks, and a great cough of steam, and the umbilicals detached from the underside of the building, falling back into the foundation.
>
>Free of its final pinions, the building flexed its arms and stood all the way up.  And, shaking the last of the snow from its shoulders, it began to move, rolling out to the wide road before it.

>Behind it, another apartment building shook the snow from its shoulders.  The walking district was awakening.

In which a buzzfeed clone literally reposts a buzzfeed article but with added text (though clearly the value is in the original images). "You won't guess what this buzzfeed article just posted..."

<i class="fa fa-heart"></i> [Why I'm not a Maker by Debbie Chachra](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/01/why-i-am-not-a-maker/384767/)

>Walk through a museum. Look around a city. Almost all the artifacts that we value as a society were made by or at the order of men. But behind every one is an invisible infrastructure of labor—primarily caregiving, in its various aspects—that is mostly performed by women.

This piece resonates very strongly with me. Being recently self-employed and feeling the emotions of money more keenly it really brings into focus the idea of "worth", "value" and making things... Lots to digest here but well worth the read.

<i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i> [Stuid and beautiful by Ben Pieratt](http://blog.pieratt.com/post/108646778840/stupid-and-beautiful)

>Once upon a time a vulture had no name, the eagle too. A vulture is no eagle but its hardly a vulture either. So it is with us. We’re neither animal nor mineral nor behavior nor dictionary. You are you, stupid and smart, beautiful and awful, 100% the truth of yourself, no matter what anyone Says.

My god - this is beautiful, heartbreaking writing in 12 short paragraphs from Ben Pieratt. Ben - I love you and want to hug you. I'm terrible at money and taxes too.
