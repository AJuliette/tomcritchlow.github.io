title: Two years on the road
subtitle: It's two years on the day since I quit my job and went out on my own. Some thoughts.

Two years ago today I walked out on my old job and decided to have a go at the whole self-employed thing. It's been a fun ride and I'd like to talk about it a little bit. Maybe I can be helpful to those behind me, maybe those in front of me can add their wisdom. Maybe I just need to write.

Being independent is a lot like being on a road trip. Abandoning the social conventions of a secure home base you set off on an adventure to who-knows-where. There's a feeling of being free, but also of being untethered.

Here's some things I've learned over the last two years:

## 1. The network is everything

## 2. Invest in yourself

## 3. It's ok to grow slowly, but keep learning

## 4. Lead flow is key

## 5. Align your pricing with the client's value

But don't woryr about pricing on a project basis.

## 6. Get as close to clients as you can

## 7. Don't be afraid to do the dirty work

## 8.
