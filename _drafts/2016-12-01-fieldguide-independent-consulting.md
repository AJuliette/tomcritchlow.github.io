Let me first say - you can't become a consultant without a strong referral network and some trust signals (e.g. experience, conference speaking, blog posts)

## Finding Clients

90% of your clients will come through your referral network.

Though I know people set up lead flow through agencies and other freelancers. Personally I prefer to work directly with clients but I know successful folks probably earning more than me who depend on leads from other sources and give kickbacks.

The best marketing you can do is to a) stay top of mind for your referral network (be visible, blog etc) and b) help define for them what it is you do (and/or want to be doing)

Create a community around yourself. Seek out likeminded independents, seek out others in the industry, host roundtable discussions, host breakfast meetings, start an email list or a slack group. Starting is infinitely better than just joining, but if you have to join at least make sure you contribute instead of just lurking.

Respond fast to all inbound leads but be prepared for leads to take 3+ months to close (not all but some)

## Positioning

Heading out on your own you'll likely have ideas about what kind of work you want to be doing. But you probably won't be able to get there straight away - it took me 12-18 months before I was starting to do the really interesting work I dreamed of when I quit my job.

Don't be afraid to meander through conversations with leads - I've often had wide ranging conversations

That said, it's useful to have a clear positioning - even if it's in your own head. Try outlining the kind of companies you're best able to help and the best kind of work

Start a company and a brand. Or don't. Up to you - I know folks doing it both ways. Here's why I made the decision for me. 

## Pricing

It's ok to meander through client calls (as I mentioned above) but one thing you should have a clear idea about is pricing. It looks somewhat amatuer / cheap to say "I'll get back to with my day rate". You should have that at your fingertips and state your price with confidence.

Everyone says you should charge project based fees. They're probably right and I've included many project based prices in my proposals but ultimately almost all of my work is done on a retainer basis (ultimately tied to hours/days more or less closely).

Asking for money is weird. But you'll get over it.

I've personally been very lucky with clients paying their bills on time but almost everyone I know struggles with this so always factor in getting paid late.

## Doing the Work

You can't solve problems from 10,000ft. Get close enough to smell the client - get onsite, get invited to their slack, get integrated into basecamp, start conversations, chit chat, look in analytics.

Be comfortable switching between presentations, spreadsheets and docs (and of course slack, email and basecamp). You'll have to straddle multiple modes and lower switching costs to be effective across multiple clients throughout a working week.

## Mindset

Always be growing, don't get complacent with clients, leads or revenue.

Every client will likely want to hire you. Be prepared to resist or else face a rollercoaster every single project.

Focus.

Find a support network. There will be emotional rollercoasters.

When client work gets quiet - make the most of it. Go bike riding, play with your kids, read a book. When client work gets busy there's no one to do the work but you so you'll work evenings and weekends so take the time off when you can! 

## Admin

Start an LLC. Is't really not hard. Keep business spending and personal spending separate. When you start earning real money consider filing taxes as a C-corp (which you can still do as an LLC)

Keep costs low. In 2016 I ran consulting at 98% margin. Paying for things can feel nice but you should question if you absolutely need them - coworking space, accounting software, facebook ads, business cards - all not entirely necessary so ask yourself before you spend.

That said - spending on gifts for professional contacts, dinner with industry friends and so on is absolutely worth it.
