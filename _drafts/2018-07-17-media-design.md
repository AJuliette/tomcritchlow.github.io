subtitle: An attempt to define and describe the landscape of my work

A decade in SEO. A few years in brand marketing at Google. Enough CSS to be dangerous. An unhealthy obsession with CMSs. A blogger. Consultant and change agent. Art dealer and entrepreneur.

My career has spanned all of these things and most recently I've found myself struggling to define and describe the work. It's most certainly not SEO - but does contain some elements of it. It's not branding, though brand is a core concern. Technology? Sometimes. Content? Usually.

While on the Amtrak the other day to spend the day on-site with a client I sketched out a model for a definition I've been toying with recently called Media Design:

I'm not the first to use the word Media Design, though existing uses vary quite wildly.

A stab at how I might define this field of practice would be something like:

**Media Design: the practice of designing systems of media - understanding that content exists in an ecosystem of technology, interaction, distribution and production in a world where each of these domains is becoming increasingly fuzzy**

The four axis of Media Design as I sketched them:

- Technology: An understanding of the infrastructure that supports the media from analytics to reporting, and structural concerns like page speed, revenue and more.
- Production: An understanding of who is producing content, why, how and with what resources. From understanding how freelance resource fits into a marketing mix to understanding how research is distributed and communicated to writers and producers.
- Distribution: SEO, social, email, understanding how and where the media is distributed is a key consideration 
- Experience: The slippery form/function divide and understanding that increasingly there is a fluid and malleable relationship between the context of experience and the content itself. Things like the UX and UI of content, the brand experience, interaction design, mobile responsiveness, Google AMP and more.

If I look back at my work over the past 4 years everything starts to, maybe, make some sense within this framework of media design. As a cross-disciplinary approach that ties together several disconnected and fuzzy fields it allows for an understanding of.
