Writing in the network (aka *blogging*!) has been a wonderful thing for me. And I think more people should blog. It's the wonderful virtuous cycle of both making interesting connections while also being a way to clarify and strengthen your own ideas.

But how do you start blogging? I think most people get it wrong - when they think of blogging they think of "big B blogging". What do I mean by that? Well they think of the well known blogs that they read and imagine that they're aiming for something like it - they imagine that writing for a large audience, to create fame and fortune is the goal!

Let me tell you - neither fame nor fortune is attainable by most people.

But... that doesn't mean you shouldn't be blogging! There's value in them networked hills kiddo.

I'm gonna tell you about another approach to fame and fortune called "small b blogging".

## Network topology and the ghost of the digg homepage

People say starting a blog is harder than it used to be. That there used to be a way to write a few words, slap it online and wait for the traffic to roll in.

I call BS. It's not that it's not true exactly - but that kind of thinking is living in the shadow of the Digg homepage. Of a time when there were a small number of entry points to the network that controlled a huge amount of influence. The Digg homepage, Hacker News, Slashdot.

Crucially, these entry points to the network were **very big and very accessible**. What do I mean by that? Well - in those early days they were **very big** in the sense that if you got your content on the Digg homepage a lot of people would see it (relative to the total size of the network at the time). And they were **very accessible** in the sense that it wasn't that hard to get your content there! I recall having a bunch of Digg homepage hits and Hacker News homepage hits.

But - as the overall network has grown exponentially the network topology has changed. Digg, Reddit, Hacker News etc all still exist but the audience you can reach with a "homepage" hit there has become much smaller relative to the overall size of the network. And getting a homepage hit there is harder than ever because the volume of content has increased exponentially.

This causes the curious effect of people thinking it's harder than ever to reach an audience online. "It's not like it used to be".

But! As the network grows and these large entry points to the network shrink in relative power new entry points emerge - new ways to reach clusters of audience faster than ever before.

Want to reach an audience of marketers online? Hacker News used to be your best bet (despite the fact that it's mostly engineers and startup junkies!). Now you have inbound.org, growthhackers.net, Moz has a widely read newsletter, etc etc etc.

Every community now has a fragmented number of communities, homepages, entry points, influencers and networks. They overlap in weird and wonderful ways - and it means that it's harder than ever to feel like you got a "homepage" success on these networks. To create a moment that has the whole audience looking at the same thing at the same time.

The natural consequence of these fragmented audience is that getting some traction with one or more of these smaller entry points is easier than it ever was.

So, getting a post read by "everyone" is harder than ever but reaching hundreds or low thousands of audience has never been easier.

But does that compute with our mental model of blogging?

## Small b blogging

I'd like to propose a new mental model for blogging - small b blogging. Let me show you what I mean.

Middle of last year I wrote one of my most widely read blog posts - [the consultant's grain](http://tomcritchlow.com/2017/07/18/the-consultants-grain/). Checking analytics I see that it has 2500 lifetime pageviews. It's not nothing but as one of my "biggest" posts it's a small audience by anyone's measure.

And yet. That single post has been directly led to two podcast appearances, at least one client, several coffee meetings with other independent consultants and more interesting conversations than I can remember.

This post - [f* yeah side projects](http://www.tomcritchlow.com/2017/01/26/f-yeah-side-projects/) - has 1,614 lifetime pageviews. But was included in two email newsletters from people I respect, created at least one coffee meeting I can remember directly came from that post and, perhaps most importantly, is a story I re-tell often and use as a fable for folks asking for career and interview advice.

What's going on here? I call it small b blogging. I'm carving out interesting connections in the network and using my blog as a way to clarify my thinking (and writing) and create connections. I'm not reaching a big audience by any measure but the direct impact and benefit is material.

Small b blogging is learning to write and think *with* the network. Small b blogging is writing content designed for small deliberate audiences and sending it to them (either directly via email, DM etc or indirectly with a homepage hit on a smaller network).

And remember that you are your own audience. Small b blogging is writing things that you link back to and reference time and time again. Ideas that can evolve and grow in and with the network.

As Venkatesh says - release, reference rework. That's the small b blogging model.

## Why writing for Medium, Inc, Entrepreneur is a mistake

Big B blogging follows the model that if you're going to write something you should chase pageviews. Get it in a prestigious publication, or place it somewhere with an in-built audience. i.e. Medium or Inc or Entrepreneur etc.

It's so alluring to want to write something there because you'll get more page views than if you put it on your own site and you'll get the prestige of saying you were published in Fast Company (or, or etc).

But what is lost by following big B blogging? By chasing scale and reputation we lose the ability to be ourselves. Your personal identity is necessarily watered down. Yes those places have large audiences but they're shallow audiences. They don't care about **you** at all. Your writing washes through their feeds like water.

Instead - I think most people would be better served by chasing small b blogging. What you want is something with YOUR personality. Writing and ideas that are addressable (i.e. you can find and link to them easily in the future) and archived (i.e. you have a list of things you've written all in one place rather than spread across publications and URLs) and memorable (i.e. has your own design, logo or style).

When you write for someone else's publication your writing becomes disparate and UN-networked. By chasing scale and pageviews you lose identity and the ability to create meaningful, memorable connections within the network.

(Yes, I know this is not zero sum - you can write for Inc AND your own blog but in practice most people don't have the bandwidth for this. And yes, you can generate interesting conversations through exposure on Fast Company, of course, there's exceptions to every rule)

Oh, and one last thing. Stick with small b blogging long enough and you'll build a bigger audience than you could ever dream of.
