A navigation is just a question. A dumb one. Like an old school phone tree.

The thing is, most of us who've hung out on the web for a while would rather ask one question because clicking a link used to be a serious thing. The page goes blank. A new page loads. It's slow. Pondersome. You certainly don't want to hop-hop-hop through pages.

But the web is new and different. It's alive now.
