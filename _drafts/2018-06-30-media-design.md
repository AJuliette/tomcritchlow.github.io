title: High Fidelity Consulting
subtitle: Give the answer, not a recommendation
---

I made a mistake yesterday. Not a big one but one I should have known better.

While putting together a strategy memo for a client I slipped into hypotheticals. I proposed some made-up and not well thought out scenarios to add color to a point I was trying to make. It's a stupid error and I regret it.

You see one of the things I've learned while consulting is that recommendations are close to worthless. The idea of "you should..." or "make it better..." or "we could..." are weak, empty, non-useful concepts that wither on the vine of dusty powerpoints slides.

And, crucially, these half formed hypothetical suggestions or recommendations are often too vague or generic to properly critique.

Instead - I try and force myself with every recommendation to get as close as possible to the actual thing itself. 

Some examples:

Recommending that the client builds a dashboard? Here's a proof of concept in Google datastudio.

Recommending that they redesign their product pages? Here's a mock-up of a new product page.

Recommending they improve their content brief for writers? Here's 3 new briefs.

Recommending infinite scroll on a categroy page - here's some javascript that you can use to see it in action on your site



Why does this work?

- Never underestimate vision. Never take experience for granted.
- Allows actual useful critique of the idea.
- Better aligns teams 
- Sometimes the thing you made is good enough to become a prototype for testing and feedback with users







Is this post centaur consulting?


The fidelity of recommendations matters. Sometimes it's important to outline an idea at a high level. Conceptually we want something like this...

But more often I find it interesting to build prototypes of ideas that are as close to the final output as possible.






## Media Design & Why I Hate Wireframes



Don't recommend the thing. Show the thing

Packed into a visual mock-up of a page is a strong point of view. Experience of what works. Some notion of requirements.

High fidelity consulting. Show don't tell.



Iterate.


If you're recommending a client do something that you've not done directly yourself you're gonna run into problems.

I made a mistake yesterday. I wrote a strategy memo. Got a meeting with the GM. Hypotheticals are death. What ifs.... Low fidelity consulting. Theory.

What should have I done? High fidelity. Mock-up the campaign. How long would it have taken? 10 minutes.

I hate wireframes. I'd much rather make a fully featured bad design than an accurate but lifeless wireframe
