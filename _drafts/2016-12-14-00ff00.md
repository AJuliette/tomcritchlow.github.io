subtitle: Why scrappy remixing and copy pasting is how I get around on the web

I just moved this site over to Tachyons. Why? Because I can. It's a framework that is pretty easy to get started with and it allows you to build front-end code easily and extensibly.

And this site uses only one font and one color (ok, plus a grey for the footer and a black for the font).

The color I use? #00ff00. Why? Because it's the default "neon green" in Google Docs. Which was where I designed this site initially.

See how far this rabbit hole goes?

## The Web Is a Remix





## Google Sheets as Data Gathering

Sumome on importxml / distilled guide importxml

THings I've used this for - a client wanted to know who worked at a competitors company

Crawling a client's site to grab review count for a bunch of products (their devs could have done that in a few hours, I did it in a few minutes).

## Python for Poets

Appengine because there's no appengine for poets

## Graphics 101

Link to Medium post.

## Hosting How?

Spinning up a website is now Github (note, Github has a very steep learning curve!!)


So where are the next edges? Publishing - I'm experimenting with blurb and lulu and some others to figure out fast ways to get things printed (hint - using Google Slides for layout and exporting as PDF).
