This site uses one font and one color (plus a grey for the footer, and a black for the font) inspired by ia.net.

So where are the next edges? Publishing - I'm experimenting with blurb and lulu and some others to figure out fast ways to get things printed (hint - using Google Slides for layout and exporting as PDF).
