I love maps. Three glimpses of geo-spatial data in my life:

*Aged 10(?), staying up late on holiday in the south of France devouring Lord of the Rings, flipping back and forth between the text and the map of Middle Earth on the front pages. I'd go on to basically only read books in my teenage years that had maps drawn in the front of them.*

*Aged 32, it's 4am and I'm yelling at the Uber driver to get us to NYU hospital. Erin is in labour in the back seat. Turns out NYU hospital is not the correct name of the hospital and the Uber driver couldn't start driving until we'd discovered that the name of the hospital on Google Maps is Tisch hospital*

*Aged 34, I'm sat at a bar on my own with my heart pounding. Every 10 minutes or so I get a text message sent via Twilio as Erin works her way through a digital-driven treasure hunt using GPS data on her phone to uncover clues to find me so I could get down on one knee and propose. Yes, I built a Glitch app to build a treasure hunt to propose to Erin.*

I love maps.

So - when I discovered recently that Shannon Mattern's [Maps as Media](http://www.wordsinspace.net/mapsmedia/fall2018/) course at the New School has all of the materials posted online and that the course runs Aug - Dec and I could follow along I thought I should do this!

I'm going to be following along - doing the readings and posting some thoughts to my blog here.

I'll be collecting all of the posts under the "maps as media" tag here:

The isle of man is about the same size as my experience of NYC - i.e. manhattan + brooklyn.
