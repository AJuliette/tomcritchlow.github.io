TL;DR - 

What have I been up to?

Insights:
- companies oftne don't know how to hire people
- hiring is hard and time consuming
- making a mistake hiring people 
 
## How I got here

Client out in Seattle helped to find and source candidates.

## Consultant vs Recruiter?

It's important not to choose too soon. Explore the options. Just because you're struggling with growth doesn't mean that hiring a "VP of growth" will solve your problems.

## The 18-month mistake

What about hiring the wrong VP of Marketing? What does that do for you?

## Giving a shit about the people

How do you care more closely about the people involved?
I'm going to start exploring options for being involved post-hire too. Long term relationships with my clients where I can shepherd and guide their strategy as well as find and build the team.

The first 90 days are critical

People is the engine.
