Here's what it needs:

Branding!
You can't get to the about page. What even IS the about page?
How do you instantly recognize a recode URL in your feed?


A point of view. You're not news.
What is your point of view on AI?
Kara's POV is strong
Quartzy?

Promote the voices of the individuals.

The podcast is great. The newsletter is great. Promote them with real CTAs

Bullets and real digests

Hero content. What are you *known* for? Data viz in service of big hitting items.

Understand your audience
Insights = better ads
Why are ads on recode just generic vox ads?

Gather your audience

What's the identity moment for non-code attendees that like recode?
Schwag? Community? Facebook group? Slack channel?

Can we learn from Skift?
