Hi there. I'm living in Brooklyn, NY and in summertime I bike all over the place. In winter I warm my hands on the gentle CPUs of my macbook. Constants are cats and coffee.

Here's what I'm up to right now:

 - Building an independent consulting practice ([I just passed two years at this](http://tomcritchlow.com/2016/10/24/2-years/))
 - Figuring out what it means to be a dad to my 7-month old daughter
 - Sketching out what a platform for NYC marketing startup recruiting would look like
 - Running an informal [breakfast meetup](http://tomcritchlow.com/breakfast/) for the content curious  
 - Running an <a href="http://www.fiercelycurious.com">art business</a>
 - One day, maybe, launching a science fiction publishing company
 
In the past I've done a lot of conference speaking - I'm open to new speaking opportunities so get in touch if you have an event you'd like me to speak at.

I'm always looking to grab coffee with interesting people so get in touch: <a href="mailto:tjcritchlow@gmail.com">tjcritchlow@gmail.com</a>
