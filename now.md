subtitle: What I'm working on now, inspired by Derek Sivers

I enjoy hanging out at the intersection of digital art, science fiction, bike riding, content marketing, strategy consulting, the beauty of mathematics and the essential joy of exercise.

My personal mantra is: move. think. create.

I'm living in Brooklyn, NY and in summertime I bike all over the place. In winter I warm my hands on the gentle CPUs of my macbook. Constants are cats and coffee.

Here's what I'm up to right now:

 - Running an independent digital strategy consulting practice. I've been at this almost three years now and have worked with some great brands like The New York Times and Complex Media
 - Connecting with and helping other independent folks building their own freelance/consulting pratice. See here: [the consultant's grain](http://tomcritchlow.com/2017/07/18/the-consultants-grain/)
 - As much as I can being present and full of life for my 17-month old daughter
 - Creating an <a href="http://www.fiercelycurious.com">art business</a> for Brooklyn artists
 - I just joined a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu studio and I'm enjoying being a complete beginner
 - One day, maybe, launching a science fiction publishing company
 
In the past I've done a lot of conference speaking - I'm open to new speaking opportunities so get in touch if you have an event you'd like me to speak at.

I'm always looking to grab coffee with interesting people so get in touch: <a href="mailto:tjcritchlow@gmail.com">tjcritchlow@gmail.com</a>
