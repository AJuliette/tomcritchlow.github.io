Hi there. I'm living in Brooklyn, NY and can usually be found either drinking coffee or riding my bike. Occasionally both.

Here's what I'm up to right now:

 - Freelance marketing consulting for mid-size startups
 - Sketching out what a marketing/growth bootcamp would look like as a "productized" version of my growth consulting for emerging startups (interested in being my test subject?)
 - Building a specialized recruitment business specifically for senior marketing candidates - need to hire or looking for a new job? Ping me! 
 - Running an <a href="http://www.fiercelycurious.com">art business</a>.
 - At the early stages of sketching out a new venture - a science fiction publishing company. Codename <a href="http://www.sentientscifi.com">Sentient</a>.
 
In the past I've done a lot of conference speaking - I'm open to new speaking opportunities so get in touch if you have an event you'd like me to speak at.

I'm always looking to grab coffee with interesting people so get in touch: <a href="mailto:tjcritchlow@gmail.com">tjcritchlow@gmail.com</a>
