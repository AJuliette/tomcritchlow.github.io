You would think that being a consultant is easy. Clients hire you to help change their company in some way. You make some recommendations and provide some insights and then...

The change rarely happens like you recommended.

Why is that? Well, we think consulting is:

*analysis -> insight -> recommendation -> review -> implementation*

At best this is too simple, at worst it's flat out wrong. The problem is just below the surface - you're hired to change their company **in a way they've so far been unable to change**. That simple addition starts to help us understand the complexity and challenges of "consulting" or "strategy".

In summary - the kwy to effective consulting is to first understand the culture within the organization that resisted this change. And then recognize that you can certainly have small wins but change "against the grain" of the culture takes a long time and requires changing people's beliefs at scale.

We're just scratching the surface here though. Read on to get deeper down this rabbithole.

## A primer on effecting change: the consultant's toolkit

First things first let's take a look at some basics. When you're trying to make change it's important to understand what kind of change you're looking for and choosing the appropriate tool for the job. Pretty much everything I know about effective consulting I learned from my brother and he wrote a nice piece on [better business documents](https://www.distilled.net/resources/better-business-documents-guide/) where he outlines the pyramid of documents.

I always try and follow this model and will switch between formats and medium often during a consulting engagement depending on the work. For example - here's a taste of the range of work produced during a single client engagement (some work I did for the New York Times Cooking site a few years back).

This can be helpful - especially if you explicitly take the time to really think through who your audience is for a given recommendation and think about what medium will suit it best (sometimes multiple mediums!).

But this is only scratching the surface.

## The New Consultant's Toolkit - Mockups & Prototypes

While the above framework is useful, recently I've found that I can be far more effective by getting closer to the output. What do I mean by that? Well - documents are almost never the actual output we're looking for. Usually we're looking for teams to be hired, or landing pages to be made or videos to be shot etc.

Imagine we were trying to convince Etsy to allow videos within product listings. One piece of the puzzle might involve a simple screenshot faked up using inspect element:

![](/images/grain/etsy.png)

The modern web is such a remixable medium that I urge you to think how you can build an MVP or prototype of the change you're recommending. The most simple way to do this is using inspect element in chrome to change up a site and then take a screenshot. Being able to see language, design and formats in play within the very medium we're discussing can be very effective. Here's a screenshot of a prototype I built for a client to demonstrate an idea:

![](/images/grain/fmt.png)

There are a million different tools to generate mockups and prototypes (which is the beauty!) but my goto tools are:

- Chrome's inspect element for small changes and tweaks (protip you can take mobile mockups this way too using the device switcher, and even add a device frame to the screenshot too)
- Google slides for mockups and more design-focused work. [Read more about how I do that here](https://medium.com/@tomcritchlow/how-to-use-google-slides-as-a-free-cloud-hosted-illustrator-replacement-f472e6c3a881).
- [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) for functioning prototypes and 

This approach will help you get closer to producing recommendations and ideas that resemble the finished product, that's a good thing. But it still doesn't answer the central question - who are we trying to convince, and what objections do they have?

## The Crux: Companies have a grain.

Here's the thing. When you're hired to do a job you have to understand that when you're hired to help with a change that they've been unable to make on their own you have to address the central question:

**Why have they been unable to make this change on their own?**

And now we get to the crux - every company has a deep rooted culture. Some talk about it explicitly, some paint it on their walls, some just breathe it every day. But every company has a culture. And that culture comes from the people - the messy organic interactions between founders, executives, workers, passionate employees, internal writing, internal talks, external press coverage and so much more.

So before you even look at the toolkit above of different mediums for change you have to think clearly about whether what you're looking to do cuts with the grain or against the grain of the organization.

Going with the grain is fast, easy, seamless and requires moving fast and mostly just making the way forward more clear.

Going against the grain is hard, messy, slow and can cause friction.

So how do we understand which way the grain goes? How do you understand culture as a consultant?

## 4 ways to better understand a client's culture

Sometimes I wish I could be a organizational anthropologist for a living. The undocumented every day lives of workers within systems (and how technology plays a role) is fascinating and nuanced. There's no real blueprint to follow here. But here are some of the ways that I've found helpful to quickly get to the heart of what an organizations culture *is*:

- **Get close enough to smell the client** - by this I mean you should be meeting with them face to face wherever possible. Sit in meetings, run workshops, sit next to them while they work, overhear them on phone calls, go for lunch with them. And the digital equivalent is just as important - don't settle for the sanitized presentations and polished documents they send to you - get invited to their slack, get access to their internal wiki, get inside their basecamp, get under the skin and into the spaces between the work. This helps you listen and understand what's really going on but it also allows you to observe the small things - what kinds of wins do they celebrate? Do they work cross-functionally? Are there obvious tensions between groups or people?
- **Listen to the language** - language and culture and inextricably linked so one of the best ways to understand culture if you can listen to enough chatter you can pick up on repeated phrases, repeated company myths, often cited documents or projects. Listen for patterns and repetition to really get a feel for the markers by which people are judging and aligning their work.
- **Take them seriously** - this is a tricky one and requires careful listening. When you're in a meeting (usually with execs) you'll hear them explain a project in often outrageous ways, e.g. "I want a website where there's just an auto playing video!! I mean, not quite like that obviously but you hear what I'm saying?". It's easy to dismiss this as aggressive or sensational language from someone passionate about the business. But listen carefully and don't dismiss their ideas immediately, there's a lot more truth in their request than you might assume and it'll tell you more about how they think about their business than almsot anything else.
- **Assume everything is deliberate** - Don't assume malice, but assume that everything is as it is because someone wanted it that way. Because mostly that's how it happens. For example - a client might sound receptive to the idea of a new design for the website but remember that their current design was chosen and deliberate. They might tell you that "it's jut not been a priority but we do want to do it!" but what that really means is that they have intentionally deprioritized it until now. Why? What *have* they been prioritizing? That will shed light on their culture and how they think about their business. Actions speak louder than words.

## Consulting Fast & Slow 

Ok - so now we're starting to understand the culture of the environment around us do we only go with the grain? Do we abandon projects that run against the grain?

Here's how I think about it - you can (and should) go against the grain of the organization. That's where the big important work is done. You just have to think about it differently.

I call this consulting fast and slow (inspired by the book *thinking fast and slow*). Fast consulting is the aforementioned projects, ideas and change that runs with the grain.

Slow consulting is the work that runs against the grain, and I think about it a lot like running a campaign. You have to gather buy in from a lot of people 

Going against hte grain is slow.

Campaign for change. Grassroots change.

In my own work I enjoy having "hard" and "soft" skills and combining them in a way to enable me to add immediate short term value to projects (like content strategy or SEO audits) which buys me enough time to stick around long enough to campaign for change like new brands, new business models, acquisitions, teams and more.

WHy blogging is effective. You're not looking for sign off, you're looking for followers. Belivers.

When I was working at Google I recall there were projects I tried to get off the ground but ultimately failed to do. One in particular was a slack-like 

The other was an idea to 

Both ideas got shut down by executives and saw little distribution.

Contrast that to the kind of change you can have with a well written memo that is designed to be easy to circulate.

But what does **easy to circulate** mean for you? Mostly I encourage people to think of this as blogging.

## The Consultant Has Bias Too

Which brings me to the title of this piece.

You're hired to change their company in a way they've so far been unable to change •and you approach with your own ideas of what should be changed•.

Oh.

Truly effective consulting aims to remove any bias from the consultant. Do I believe content can be an effective tool? Yes. Do I believe exposing more information about the company to the public is usually a good thing? Yes. Are these always what the client needs? No way.



Being a consultant is, in essence, an exercise in effecting change. Clients hire me to make some kind of change within their business. And, b


I also propose some new forms - why workshops don't work. Why we should be understanding problems before chasing solutions but creating fast MVPs that are real enough to get behind.

The consultant's grain.

The typical heirarchy is decks - documents - data

My favorite way to deliver consulting? Screenshots. Fiddling with pages in code, showing how it feels in the browser. There's something powerful there. All of my failed recommendations.

A story of blogging inside Google. -> many good consultants are strong writers.

Understand that you're working against a mindset. Entrenched opinions and ideas. Ways of thinking.

What consulting looks like.

On Documents

new Documents
mockups & code

Beyond documents - affecting change
workshops
smellling the clients problems
slack / basecamp

Plugging leaks
 - example SEO reporting spreadsheet
 - outreach to hiring folks
 - 

Working with the client's grain
- you can't put lipstick on a pig
- the benign consultant

Sniffing clients. Getting close enough to smell them.

Basic thesis - you need a humanities interest and diverse background, fluent in people and data and comfortable using powerpoint, doc and excel, but let's add a new one - code and design. I.e. prototypes.

New ideas, directions and concepts bleed out across organizations. They don't come out of nowhere but equally no ideas ever really die. They become assimilated into the knowledge of the organization.
