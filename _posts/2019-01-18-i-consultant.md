The thing no one tells you when you set out on your own is that you take on the task of shaping your own identity. A slowly unfurling project of internalizing and externalizing your hopes and dreams.

When we're fully employed, as well as a steady pay-check we get a stable (and often somewhat standardized) label. I'm a "product manager at brand corp". When you step out on your own you suddenly remove the construct that provides this plug-and-play identity and are left to make one up on your own.

This can feel like "soft" work, somehow less important than the "real" work of finding clients and setting up an LLC etc. But the truth is that this evolving and shaping of your personal identity - the labels and language you use to describe yourself and the work you do - is the platform upon which everything hinges.

What kind of clients do you work for?

What kind of work do you find fulfilling?

How do you legitimize charging good money?

These questions all hinge on the notion of identity.

## Tend your Identity as it Evolves

When you first leap into the unknown it's often easy to describe who you are - you're defined by what you just left. "I just quit Google to head out on my own". Defined by the recent past, this framing is easy, safe and totally fine. Much like the Cobra health insurance you're drafting off you're drafting off the coat-tails of your previous role.

As the days turn into weeks and months though, new language will emerge.

In the early days of heading out on my own I would use the word "consulting" to describe the client work (largely because that's how I'd described it while I was at Distilled pre-Google when I was doing client work). But it didn't feel right to call myself a "consultant" yet.

Self-employed? Sure. (though that implies that I'm paying the bills?)

Freelancer. Probably. (though that implies a short term version of full-time work?)

In my experience there's a bit of a spectrum - people gravitate to different language based on what they want to be known as and how confident they feel.

It's a process of growing into the person you want to be.

Consider the following range of terms:

In my experience there's usually a bit of a trajectory. As you move from nervous beginner to confident experience the language evolves. Something like:

- Freelancer
- Self-employed
- "Specialist" (e.g. "Marketer" or "Web designer")
- Consultant
- Founder / Owner
- CEO

The angst here comes in two ways:

Firstly, you imagine that this label matters **externally**. Positioning is often discussed in the context of "market positioning" or "positioning statement" - something that helps potential clients find and engage with you. That's true, to a degree. But I'd argue that for many independents the actual label you use is less important for potential clients. They tend to look for evidence, content, associations and perspective that aligns with theirs. They tend to be indifferent to the difference between a consultant and a freelancer.

Secondly, you imagine that you have to **earn** your label. That somehow others have the power to *grant* you use of a label. This is BS and you should moondance past anyone who tries to be a gatekeeper in any way. Part of being untethered and free-floating independent is existing outside of the gatekeeper infrastructure.

## Psychic Armor for the Arena of Capitalism

This identity formation is not just aspirational - it's functional in one key way.

The best advice you can get when you're starting out as an independent is to raise your rates. Charge more. Value your worth higher.

This is often-repeated advice, not because people get it wrong as much as.... it's hard! Having the self-confidence and authority to command premium rates is intrinsically linked to a sense of self-worth and identity.

So this idea of creating a personal identity via your independent work is important as psychic armor as you step into the arena of capitalism. You need a construct to do the charging *for you*.

For me personally I think not in terms of Tom Critchlow sending you this invoice, but in terms of *my consulting business* sending you this invoice.

Develop a capitalist construct. For me - consultant == $$. For others studio name == $$. The worst thing to do is to hold too tightly to a sense of "authenticity" or "identity" that prevents you from playing the capitalist rodeo.

## A Studio of One's Own

Once you've developed a label you like, it's time to expand your identity into the *space you work in*. I'm not talking about the physical space you work in (though that has some notions of identity formation also...), but rather the metaphorical space you work in. What environment are you crafting that houses your client work?

Some words you might use:

- Lab
- Studio
- Agency
- Office
- Nomad

More  than a personal identity - these terms reflect your aspirations for the kind of work you want to do.

I've wrestled with this for a long time. Many of those I look up to have created "studios" to house their work.

I've spent at least the last two years wrestling with the idea of a "studio". Artists have studios. Designers have studios. Creatives have studios.

A studio practice is something I desire.

But all of this is a yearning for creativity. Or, more accurately a yearning for the **label** of creativity.

Ah. Now we're getting somewhere. Peel those layers.

## Poetry over Power

Many times titles and labels are a show of power. Some display of strength over others. **I have this label** is the same as saying **I have this power**.

From the book *Finite & Infinite Games*{% include tufte-sn.html id="infinite" content="A wonderful book that I need to write more about soon..." %} this quote:

> “Therefore, poets do not 'fit' into society, not because a place is denied them but because they do not take their 'places' seriously. They openly see its roles as theatrical, its styles as poses, its clothing costumes, its rules conventional, its crises arranged, its conflicts performed and its metaphysics ideological.” 

So play with labels, understand their power not over others but over ourselves. Understand their ability to provide shelter in the capitalist storm and then, eventually, discard them entirely and embrace the poetry of life.
