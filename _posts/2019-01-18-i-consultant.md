The thing no one tells you when you set out on your own is that you take on the task of shaping your own identity. A slowly unfurling project of internalizing and externalizing your hopes and dreams.

This can feel like "soft" work, somehow less important than the "real" work of finding clients and setting up an LLC etc. But the truth is that this evolving and shaping of your personal identity - the labels and language you use to describe yourself and the work you do - is the platform upon which everything hinges.

What kind of clients do you work for?

What kind of work do you find fulfilling?

How do you legitimize charging good money?

These questions all hinge on the notion of identity.

## Tend your Identity as it Evolves

When you first leap into the unknown it's often easy to describe who you are - you're defined by what you just left. "I just quit Google to head out on my own". Defined by the recent past, this framing is easy, safe and totally fine. Much like the Cobra health insurance you're drafting off you're drafting off the coat-tails of your previous role.

As the days turn into weeks and months though, new language will emerge.

In the early days of heading out on my own I would use the word "consulting" to describe the client work (largely because that's how I'd described it while I was at Distilled pre-Google when I was doing client work). But it didn't feel right to call myself a "consultant" yet.

Self-employed? Sure. (though that implies that I'm paying the bills?)

Freelancer. Probably. (though that implies a short term version of full-time work?)

In my experience there's a bit of a spectrum - people gravitate to different language based on what they want to be known as and how confident they feel.

It's a process of growing into the person you want to be.

Consider the following range of terms:

In my experience there's usually a bit of a trajectory. As you move from nervous beginner to confident experience the language evolves. Something like:

- Freelancer
- Self-employed
- "Specialist" (e.g. "Marketer" or "Web designer")
- Consultant
- Founder / Owner
- CEO

The angst here comes in two ways:

Firstly, you imagine that this language matters to 

Secondly, you imagine that 

In truth - this is less of a linear journey and more of a choice. A 2x2.

Freelance <--> Consultant
Owner <--> Founder

These terms matter! Not to clients - they rarely care - but to you! To your sense of identity and self-worth.

But there's another dimension here - functional or creative.

I've spent at least the last two years wrestling with the idea of a "studio". Artists have studios. Designers have studios. Creatives have studios.

A studio practice is something I desire.

But all of this is a yearning for creativity. Or, more accurately a yearning for the **label** of creativity.

Ah. Now we're getting somewhere. Peel those layers.

## Psychic Armor for the Arena of Capitalism

Develop a capitalist construct. For me - consultant == $$. For others studio name == $$. The worst thing to do is to hold too tightly to a sense of "authenticity" or "identity" that prevents you from playing the capitalist rodeo.

Armor you use when you enter the arena of capitalism.

When I set out on my own it felt important to create a positioning statement. An clear differentiation from others, a way to describe the work I do and who I do it for.

This positioning statement feels like it's "for the market" - for others. External.

As I wrestled with putting this together - and wrestled with when and where I exposed this positioning statement to the world it became increasingly clear that the positioning statement was far more important as an internal thing. For me.

When you become self-employed you also take on the task of shaping your identity.

The language we use is most useful to ourselves as an internal narrative. Something to keep us anchored during the choppy waters of untethered freelance work.
