title: Strategy is the organic flow of ideas and people
subtitle: Three links to chew on...
---

I'm currently reading the wonderful book *Seeking like a state* about how top-down ideas for change inspired by high modernism often fail because they don't accurately reflect the organic nature of networks and people.

I can't help but feel that most top-down strategy fails for the same reason.

Here's three things I've read recently on that topic but I'm eager for more so please share other interesting links in the comments!

## Strategy as an Unfolding Network of Associations

This paper from Stripe Partners is wonderful. They first run a strategy session for a client then, since they're an ethnographic research agency, they go back to the client a year later and try and understand "what happened" to the strategy and ideas that came from that session. Wonderful stuff:

## Strategic thinking with blog posts and stickers

This post from Giles is short but really cuts to the heart of how strategy actually functions - small ideas reinforced and deliberatly shared by the folks in the thick of it...

And be sure to check out his [archive of posters](https://gilest.org/posters.html) at the GDS too...

## Small groups and consultancy

I've linked to this piece many times from Matt Webb because I think of it often:

> My hunch is this: To answer a business's strategic questions, which will intrinsically involve changing that business, a more permanent solution than a visiting consultant might be to convene a small group, and spend time with it, chatting informally.

Yeah!

Still trying to find a way to bring this into my own consulting work....
