2015 is a year of adventure for me. And one of those adventures is dedicating myself to a practice of digital art. Here is my first piece, called *Glitch Cookies*.

What are we looking at here?

The thinking here is to use glitch art techniques to expose the contrast between the visible and invisible - through the lens of mainstream news culture. What is said and not said? What is visible and not visible? How do these structures play out and in particular how much do we suffer from hidden power structures that exist beyond our line of sight. To quote the matrix - they're in the walls.

## The Making of Glitch Cookies

Here's a step by step guide to making Glitch Cookies.

Step 1) Get a screenshot of the homepage of the New York Times (12.28pm May 13th, 2015). (Achieved using the Google Drive Chrome plugin to capture the whole page - interestingly we're already seeing glitches start to emerge in the image).

Step 2) Collect all the cookies dropped (12:20pm Wed May 13th, 2015). I did this by copy and pasting from the Chrome resources window: (this may also have introduced some glitches...)

Step 3) Modify the glitch python code found here, to insert all the cookies randomly within the jpg file.

Step 4) Run code several times to generate new glitch cookie artworks.

I'm printing up some physical books - magazine size with 30 new pieces of Glitch Cookie art. I'm waiting on the physical proofs from the printer - if you want one please drop me an email: <a href="mailto:tjcritchlow@gmail.com">tjcritchlow@gmail.com</a>
