Content and technology have never been so interconnected and interdependent.

We live in an age where the form & function of content is tied to, and sits upon, rapidly evolving and iterating technologies. Meanwhile, technology is increasingly generating, manipulating and pushing content to users in new ways.

My entire career has been spent here. Understanding the texture of content in the age of technology.

A decade in SEO. A few years in brand marketing at Google. Enough CSS to be dangerous. An unhealthy obsession with CMSs. A blogger. Consultant and change agent. Art dealer and entrepreneur.

My career has spanned all of these things but I often end up struggling to define and describe the work I do.

I've been toying with the concept of **Media Design** recently, with a sketch of how this practice might be defined:

**Media Design: the practice of designing systems of media - understanding that content exists in an ecosystem of technology, interaction, distribution and production in a world where each of these domains is becoming increasingly fuzzy**

While on the Amtrak the other day to spend the day on-site with a client I sketched out a model for how this system functions:

The four axis of Media Design as I sketched them:

- **Technology**: An understanding of the infrastructure that supports the media - from analytics to reporting, from revenue to technology. Concerns here are often around site architecture, site speed, monetization, tracking and more.
- **Production**: An understanding of who is producing content, how they produce content and with what resources. From understanding how freelance resource fits into a marketing mix to understanding how research is distributed and communicated to writers and producers to how briefs are written, how brand is translated into campaigns and more.
- **Distribution**: An understanding of how content is distributed - SEO, social, email, influencer marketing and more. Concerns here often focus on audience and channel.
- **Experience**: An understanding of the context in which content is experienced. The slippery form/function divide and understanding that increasingly there is a fluid and malleable relationship between the context of experience and the content itself. Things like the UX and UI of content, the brand experience, interaction design, content formats, community interactions and more.

I'm not the first to use the word Media Design, though existing uses vary quite wildly.

If I look back at my work over the past 4 years everything starts to, maybe, make some sense within this framework of media design. As a cross-disciplinary approach that ties together several disconnected and fuzzy fields it allows for an understanding of how technology and content play together.

The established labels that I commonly get asked to work on are audience development, content marketing, content strategy, SEO, growth. But the answer always starts by understanding the media design system within the client's business. How is the system operating today? How could it operate in the future?

And the interesting piece is always in the tensions between the axis.

There are limits of course - the above diagram and thinking is very much concerned with the *how* of media design. But there are other layers of *why* and *who* which I also get involved in. How companies generate systems of insight, how they scale brand positioning, how these campaigns and projects are operationalized. How you hire for media design people. All these and more. But as a label for a set of interconnected fuzzy ideas I kind of like it.

You?
