title: Poetry & Markdown for What?
---

I'm a novice when it comes to poetry.

I use Github pages wth Jeckyll to run this site. It's great because it gives me the lightweight CMS that I need that's mostly just writing text but occasionally writing code, with switching between the two seamless and easy.

Unfortuantely, Github pages uses markdown and I'm not expert on Markdown. It seems like it screws up poetry.

So the following passage:

	And we all say: OH!
	Well I never!
	Was there ever
	A Cat so clever
	As Magical Mr. Mistoffelees!

When copied and pasted into Markdown becomes:

	And we all say: OH!Well I never!Was there everA Cat so cleverAs Magical Mr. Mistoffelees!

Hmm?

	<script>
		
	$('p').each(function(){
	  var text =$(this).html();
	  var text = text.split("\n").join("<br />") 
	  $(this).html(text);
	});
	
	</script>
