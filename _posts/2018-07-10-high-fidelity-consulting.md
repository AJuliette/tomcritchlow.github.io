title: High Fidelity Consulting
subtitle: Ideas without details and details without ideas are both risky
---

This little book [Legible Practices](http://helsinkidesignlab.org/legiblepractises/index.html) from Helsinki Design Lab continues to deliver gems of wisdom:

> Ideas without details and details without ideas are both risky, so IDEO relied on high-resolution provocations that combined both. 

Ah.

There's a rich vein of wisdom tightly bound around that phrase. And something I've been appreciating more and more in my own work.

Recommendations are worthless.

"You should...."

"We could..."

"Make it better..."

"Improve the UX..."

These are empty, weak, non-useful concepts that wither on the vine of dusty powerpoint slides. And, crucially, these half formed hypothetical suggestions or recommendations are often too vague or generic to properly critique.

Instead, I've been trying to force myself to prototype every recommendation I make to clients. Some real examples from the past few months of my own consulting work:

Recommending that the client builds a dashboard? Here's a proof of concept in Google datastudio.

Recommending that they redesign their product pages? Here's a mock-up of a new product page.

Recommending they improve their content brief for writers? Here's 3 new example briefs.

Recommending infinite scroll on a category page - here's some javascript that you can use to see it in action on your site

"Ideas without details and details without ideas are equally risky" - I've been calling this high fidelity consulting. Give the final thing, or a prototype of it, rather than just a recommendation.

## Why does high fidelity consulting work?

Why does this work?

- Never underestimate vision. Never take experience for granted.
- Allows actual useful critique of the idea.
- Better aligns teams 
- Sometimes the thing you made is good enough to become a prototype for testing and feedback with users






## The Centaur Consultant









Don't recommend the thing. Show the thing

Packed into a visual mock-up of a page is a strong point of view. Experience of what works. Some notion of requirements.

High fidelity consulting. Show don't tell.



Iterate.


If you're recommending a client do something that you've not done directly yourself you're gonna run into problems.

I made a mistake yesterday. I wrote a strategy memo. Got a meeting with the GM. Hypotheticals are death. What ifs.... Low fidelity consulting. Theory.

What should have I done? High fidelity. Mock-up the campaign. How long would it have taken? 10 minutes.

I hate wireframes. I'd much rather make a fully featured bad design than an accurate but lifeless wireframe
