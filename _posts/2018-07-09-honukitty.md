title: Community Economics & A Kitty-Turtle Hybrid
subtitle: From tokens to turtles
---

My good friend Arnold has been involved in launching a new crypto-kitty that's actually a cat/turtle hybrid.

Meet [Honu](https://www.honukitty.com/).

Why is this interesting? Because it's an auction with all the proceeds going to support Operation Jairo and Unite BVI.

I'm mostly just a sideline observer of crypto. I'm interested in the technology dating all the way back to my degree paper on cryptography and error-correcting codes. But the piece of the whole thing that interests me the most is community economics and social impact.

The blockchain as a technology to enable and make legible new forms of funding and governance feels like a natural fit for non-profits and social-good projects.

Of course, my friend Arnold has been thinking and publishing about this for a while:

Anyway. Roxy loves turtles and I left a bid for Honu.

Asking for a real application of blockchain? Here it is, from tokens to turtles.
