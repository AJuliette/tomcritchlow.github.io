title: The Consultant's Grain
subtitle: (Their) Culture eats (your) strategy for breakfast. Some thoughts on adapting to an organization's culture
---

You would think that being a consultant is easy. Clients hire you to help change their company in some way. You make some recommendations and provide some insights and then...

The change rarely happens like you recommended.

Why is that? Well, we think consulting is:

*analysis -> insight -> recommendation -> review -> implementation*

At best this is too simple, at worst it's flat out wrong. The problem is just below the surface - you're hired to change their company **in a way they've so far been unable to change**. That simple addition starts to help us understand the complexity and challenges of "consulting" or "strategy".

In summary - the key to effective consulting is to first understand the culture within the organization that resisted this change. And then recognize that you can certainly have small wins but change "against the grain" of the culture takes a long time and requires changing people's beliefs at scale.

## Every company has a grain

When you're hired to do a job you have to understand the central question:

**Why have they been unable to make this change on their own?**

Every company has a deep rooted culture. Some talk about it explicitly, some paint it on their walls, some just breathe it every day. But every company has a culture. And that culture comes from the people - the messy organic interactions between founders, executives, workers, passionate employees, internal writing, internal talks, external press coverage and so much more.

So as you think about putting together a strategy and a set of recommendations for a client you have to think clearly about whether what you're looking to do cuts with the grain or against the grain of the organization.

**Going with the grain is fast, easy, seamless and requires moving fast and mostly just making the way forward more clear.**

*Example: I was working*

**Going against the grain is hard, messy, slow and can cause friction.**

*Example: convincing a company to invest in design and front-end support for their site.*

But how do we understand which way the grain goes? How do you understand culture as a consultant?

## 4 ways to better understand a client's culture

Sometimes I wish I could be an organizational anthropologist for a living. The undocumented every day lives of workers within systems (and how technology plays a role) is fascinating and nuanced. There's no real blueprint to follow here. But here are some of the ways that I've found helpful to quickly get to the heart of what an organizations culture *is*:

- **Get close enough to smell the client** - by this I mean you should be meeting with them face to face wherever possible. Sit in meetings, run workshops, sit next to them while they work, overhear them on phone calls, go for lunch with them. And the digital equivalent is just as important - don't settle for the sanitized presentations and polished documents they send to you - get invited to their slack, get access to their internal wiki, get inside their basecamp, get under the skin and into the spaces between the work. This helps you listen and understand what's really going on but it also allows you to observe the small things - what kinds of wins do they celebrate? Do they work cross-functionally? Are there obvious tensions between groups or people?
- **Listen to the language** - language and culture are inextricably linked so one of the best ways to understand culture if you can listen to enough chatter you can pick up on repeated phrases, repeated company myths, often cited documents or projects. Listen for patterns and repetition to really get a feel for the markers by which people are judging and aligning their work.
- **Take them seriously** - this is a tricky one and requires careful listening. When you're in a meeting (usually with execs) you'll hear them explain a project in often outrageous ways, e.g. "I want a website where there's just an auto playing video!! I mean, not quite like that obviously but you hear what I'm saying?". It's easy to dismiss this as aggressive or sensational language from someone passionate about the business. But listen carefully and don't dismiss their ideas immediately, there's a lot more truth in their request than you might assume and it'll tell you more about how they think about their business than almost anything else.
- **Assume everything is deliberate** - Don't assume malice, but assume that everything is as it is because someone wanted it that way. Because mostly that's how it happens. For example - a client might sound receptive to the idea of a new design for the website but remember that their current design was chosen and deliberate. They might tell you that "it's jut not been a priority but we do want to do it!" but what that really means is that they have intentionally deprioritized it until now. Why? What *have* they been prioritizing? That will shed light on their culture and how they think about their business. Actions speak louder than words.

## Consulting Fast & Slow 

Ok - so now we're starting to understand the culture of the environment around us do we only go with the grain? Do we abandon projects that run against the grain?

Here's how I think about it - you can (and should) go against the grain of the organization. That's where the big important work is done. You just have to think about it differently.

I call this consulting fast and slow (inspired by the book *[thinking fast and slow](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555)*). Fast consulting is the aforementioned projects, ideas and change that runs with the grain.

Slow consulting is the work that runs against the grain, and I think about it a lot like running a campaign. You have to gather buy in from a lot of people and essentially campaign for change. Sometimes you need to start grassroots and build momentum from an ever increasing number of people, sometimes it's a focused drip drip of belief change for key execs to get them to change their mind.

Either way the key is to run a campaign.

How might we do this? The key in my mind is to think about the change beyond the individual documents or business case and instead work to create a series of things that build an ever-increasing momentum for the direction you want to take.

This could be collecting examples of what you are saying and sending them periodically across to your client or circulating in their slack. Remember how language shapes culture? Well you can inject a little of your own culture by repeatedly using language, referencing examples and showcasing the direction you want to go in.

The more focused approach is to blog. Yes, yes, yes I know I harp on a lot about this blogging thing but seriously, blogging (i.e. serialized, shareable content) is highly effective at helping people to see things from your point of view and getting buy in and driving slow behavior change.

The key to internal company blogging is serialized, shareable content authored under your own name:
 - **Serialized** - means you don't have to create the magnum opus or manifesto overnight. Publish your thinking, publish your half-thoughts, publish your experiments, publish your examples elsewhere on the web. The point here is to create that drip drip drip so keep publishing.
 - **Shareable** - this is often the hardest piece to do well within an organization. Don't let your campaign for change get trapped within an email thread or lost in the slack stream, give it a permanent home, ideally a URL (shocking I know!). How you do this will depend a lot on what your tech stack looks like. When I was working at Google you could spin up a strictly internal appengine instance so I used it to build my own blog where I had my own URL and I could publish content. It helps when you do this to use a format that's not commonly used internally. Standing out helps any campaign gain mindshare.

If you only focus on one thing here though - focus on the idea that it has to be shareable and **easy to circulate** that could simply be with a google doc that has a big written "please distribute freely" label on it and access open to all within the company.

I've tried this a few times with Slack Notes which are in my experience a rarely used feature within Slack but could evolve into the perfect "memo-writing" platform for slow consulting.

When I was at Google (pre-slack!) we used Google+ internally as an internal social network experience and that was effective at bubbling up disparate voices who were "blogging" internally. This was a great piece that made it outside the walls: [Steve Yegge's platform rant](https://plus.google.com/+RipRowan/posts/eVeouesvaVX).

## The Consultant's Grain

Ah. There's one more piece to this puzzle. I've talked a lot about the organization's grain. This was a concept I really fully realized and started to deliberately address about a year and a half ago. But only more recently have I stumbled across the uncomfortable though obvious follow up: the consultant has a grain too.

Let's reframe that positioning of why consulting is hard - **you're hired to change their company in a way they've so far been unable to change and you will attempt to do this in ways you're comfortable with**.

It's important to realize that businesses come in so many more shapes and sizes than you read about in the tech press. And you'll have some preconvieved notions of how a business should operate, some of which may or may not work or be appropriate for that client.

In short - while you can work against the grain within an organization up to a point, there is definitely a limit to the amount of friction you can generate. Too much friction and things will get set on fire. Projects, teams, people, ideas, budgets.

So when you're considering change within an organization you have to understand your own bias and take a long hard look at which of your usual ideas and often-repeated mantras **actually** apply to this client, and which are pushing too far against the grain. And, importantly, which of your go-to ideas are explicitly **with** the grain of the organization. Because without some kind of forward motion you're not going to be able to stick around long enough to get the bigger change done.

## Further reading on consulting

Hopefully this piece is relevant both for external consultants and for internal change agents. If you found this interesting here's some further reads about the consulting world that made me think recently:

[The management myth](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2006/06/the-management-myth/304883/) - a great rallying cry for the need for humanities and human thinking and some great context on where management consulting comes from in the first place.

[Strategy as an unfolding network of associations (PDF)](http://www.stripepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Stripe_Partners_Strategy_as_a_Network.pdf) - kind of dense but fascinating case study of evaluating strategy within the context of culture:
> "The evidence from the case suggests that the concept of strategy can be reappraised. From strategy as a static set of choices made at a specific point in time to strategy as an unfolding network of people, shared experiences and artefacts that is constantly being remade"

[Small groups and consultancy](http://interconnected.org/home/2015/10/07/small_groups_and_consultancy) - by the ever brilliant Matt Webb:
> I don't think strategy can be outsourced, I think it has to emerge from a company's nature. So when strategy evolves, there has to be organisational change. When an organisation looks outside itself (for answers that should be derived from strategy) that says to me that it's not thinking straight, that the organisation isn't put together quite right yet. An organisation has these informal components, and cross-team small group meetings feel like a good way to weave them in.

[The art of sharing](https://www.epicpeople.org/the-art-of-sharing/) - Jan Chipchase is a master at this and I can't wait to read the full handbook but this excerpt is especially relevant for the sharing / campaign thinking I mention above.

[Consultancy, Creativity and Cooking with Sunday Dinner](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/consultancy-creativity-cooking-sunday-dinner-lindsey-slaby) - from the great Lindsey Slaby thinking about new ways of getting creative projects staffed, funded, connected and thought about. I love the strong emphasis on people. They are the capital at work here!
