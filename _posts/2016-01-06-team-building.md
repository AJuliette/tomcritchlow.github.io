As an early or mid-stage startup figuring out marketing (or growth[^1]) is hard.

Marketing is mostly the same[^2], but the plan is always different.

And so a good consultant can be useful.

Inevitably at some point, startups determine that marketing is valuable.

This leads to the desire to build a team. Time to "get serious" about it.

Startups often think they don't have enough knowledge of "what marketing is" to hire appropriately.

And so a recruiter can be useful.

I have done a lot of marketing consulting over the years.

I've built a number of marketing teams and been involved in hiring a lot of people.

The most effective work I've ever done has been a combination of consulting and team building.

Most recruiters[^3] are really lead gen experts and good at finding candidates, but not deeply skilled in the role they're hiring for.

My background and expertise in marketing, coupled with a strong network means I can be very effective at sourcing and qualifying the right candidates.

But there's value[^4] in caring about the bigger picture and being involved before, during and after hiring.

Which is what I'm going to be focusing on in 2016[^5].

So, if you are an early or mid-stage startup looking to build or grow your marketing team and need help get in touch.

Or, if you're working in marketing and want a job as VP marketing for an early or mid-stage startup I can help you find the right role.

[^1]: Startups like to talk about growth instead of marketing. It's usually the same kind of thing - though there is a growing trend to uncouple the two in which case growth handles acquisition and marketing handles brand. Most of this is semantics, though team structure should always be thought through carefully.

[^2]: Actually, marketing is changing and the rate at which it's changing is accelerating. But what I mean is there are tons of generic methods, tools and tactics that apply to a lot of companies.

[^3]: Recruiters have a poor reputation, just like marketers. But there are of course excellent recruiters out there already.

[^4]: Capturing this value is still a fuzzy concept for me right now. I'm planning on getting paid to do consulting and getting paid to recruit the right peolpe. Easy wins include staying on as an advisor, helping with strategy, running marketing workshops and training.

[^5]: In case this comes across as overly aspirational and seems like a new years resolution, the work I did in the second half of 2015 closely matched up to this model which makes me excited to add a little structure and start talking about it in 2016.
