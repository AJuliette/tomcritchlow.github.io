title: Where will the next Twitter come from?
subtitle: Twitter the company is in trouble, but Twitter the platform I believe will live on
---

Twitter the company is in dire straits. They've raised too much money, floundered with product improvements, squandered their acquisitions, lost too much money and finally tried to sell themselves only to have no one want to buy them. Partly because of their spam/abuse problem and seeming complete lack of ability or desire to fix it.

But, Twitter the platform is something meaningful and incredible. It's like nothing else on the web - something that a dedicated userbase is glued to almost more than any other service online. If you ignore the abuse problems it's *almost* a public good.

I'm personally invested in Twitter - I've been a user for almost 10 years and it's the app I use on my phone more than any other.

So what happens next?

Ben Thompson of [Stratechery](https://stratechery.com/) pointed out [this piece by Bronte Capital](http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2016/10/some-comment-on-twitter-buyout-rumours.html) and I think we both largely agree with the points raised. Most clearly:

>Twitter is past that. Somewhere near half a billion dollars of costs need to be taken out almost immediately. And that involves firing people and being a general tough-bastard. It's inevitable anyway - because Jack Dorsey burning half a billion dollar per year isn't a sustainable business. The cash eventually runs out. 

>The problem is if you mix this with a Salesforce.com or similar company it will be really hard to take costs out in a disciplined fashion without upsetting the culture of the home company. Instead this should be fixed (with extreme prejudice by a disinterested outsider) before it is sold again to a strategic buyer.

>Or - in summary: the best bastards are from Wall Street. And this needs a Wall Street bastard. 

So what happens next? Likely a firesale and gutting of the business. And, I'd predict, followed shortly after by a widespread abandon ship of users.

But where to?

## The Next Twitter

Who will build the next one? Could be Google. But more likely a media company. Maybe qz.
