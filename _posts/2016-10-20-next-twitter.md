title: Where will the next Twitter come from?
subtitle: Twitter the company is in trouble, but Twitter the platform I believe will live on
---

Twitter the company is in dire straits. They've raised too much money, floundered with product improvements, squandered their acquisitions, lost too much money and finally tried to sell themselves only to have no one want to buy them. Partly because of their spam/abuse problem and seeming complete lack of ability or desire to fix it.

But, Twitter the platform is something meaningful and incredible. It's like nothing else on the web - something that a dedicated userbase is glued to almost more than any other service online. If you ignore the abuse problems it's *almost* a public good.

I'm personally invested in Twitter - I've been a user for almost 10 years and it's the app I use on my phone more than any other. Venkatesh Rao [wrote a little series in his newsletter](http://us1.campaign-archive1.com/?u=78cbbb7f2882629a5157fa593&id=d6081dc3f9&e=1ef561aa73) that captured the spirit of Twitter better than any I've seen:

>1/ Hypothesis: there are technologies so basic that they serve as prequels to economic organization and utility vs. private type end-game debates

> 2/ Possible examples: Craigslist, Twitter,  Unix shell. One maybe: Wikipedia. They are all sui generis and defy analysis within categories

> 3/ They are destined neither for commodity status as private sector technologies, nor for utility status as public services.

> 4/ What they do instead is create frontier land, sparking land-grab economic races.

> ...

> 9/ Twitter "failing" to own the revolutions it obviously took mainstream (messaging, chatbots) isn't a failure really if viewed that way.

> ...

> 11/ Wrong because it's very incomplete. There's like 10-15 Slack/Snapchat sized businesses left to carve out of the "Twitter continent." Any single one is a full-time job for one company.

> 12/ Examples: Nobody has "pulled a Slack" on "political revolutions" product that's inside Twitter, or the "nascent community" product

> ...

> 24/ Twitter and Craigslist have taught us some huge new things about how hundreds of millions of networked people behave

The whole stream is worth reading.

## So what happens next?

Ben Thompson of [Stratechery](https://stratechery.com/) pointed out [this piece by Bronte Capital](http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2016/10/some-comment-on-twitter-buyout-rumours.html) and I think we both largely agree with the points raised. Most clearly:

>Twitter is past that. Somewhere near half a billion dollars of costs need to be taken out almost immediately. And that involves firing people and being a general tough-bastard. It's inevitable anyway - because Jack Dorsey burning half a billion dollar per year isn't a sustainable business. The cash eventually runs out. 

>The problem is if you mix this with a Salesforce.com or similar company it will be really hard to take costs out in a disciplined fashion without upsetting the culture of the home company. Instead this should be fixed (with extreme prejudice by a disinterested outsider) before it is sold again to a strategic buyer.

>Or - in summary: the best bastards are from Wall Street. And this needs a Wall Street bastard. 

So what happens next? Likely a firesale and gutting of the business. And, I'd predict, followed shortly after by a widespread abandon ship of users.

But where to?

## The Next Twitter

mobile first
1999.io

Who will build the next one? Could be Google. But more likely a media company. Maybe qz.
