The tappable web is an interesting place. Ever since Robin Sloan debuted Fish: a Tap Essay in 2012 I've been curious of the power and mystery of unfolding storytelling.

Of course, these days discussion of tappable stories is dominated by Instagram. The Instagram stories format is, perhaps, the fastest growing media format of all time?

There are a handful of other story formats floating around for example:

- Twitter moments ([example](https://twitter.com/i/moments/1034070233189892096?lang=en))
- Instagram stories ([example](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17907535984221261/))
- Giphy stories ([example](https://giphy.com/stories/cat-puns-1579651e-a258))
- Medium series([example](https://medium.com/series/the-best-story-in-global-health-d5442f7aee12)) (ironically these are user-hostile on mobile forcing you to read them on desktop or in the native app....)

And, of course, Robin Sloan's fish essay recently got re-mastered! I strongly encourage you to check it out: [https://www.robinsloan.com/fish/](https://www.robinsloan.com/fish/)

## AMP Stories

To date, none of the tappable story implementations have worked well on the web. I'd love to see a robust framework for making these on the open web. The closest I think is AMP stories. Until recently they were highly experimental and you had to get your domain whitelisted by Google to try them but AMP stories just reached V1.0 and is now available for everyone.

So I thought I'd play around!

I should say before I go further that I have some reservations about AMP stories. Namely:

- I'm wary of AMP generally. I think the end result of AMP speeding up the web is a GOOD THING, but the centralization and lockin and move away from the open web is troubling for me.
- AMP stories are still kind of clunky. No swiping to advance. They're just not as performant or smooth as native Instagram stories.
- 

But! I think they're going to get more focus and attention from folks and I can't imagine someone won't build an open-web tappable story experience. So let's play around and have some fun!

## How do you build a CMS for tappable stories?

Mic open story format.


A brief overview





## Here's a few example stories I made:

Ursula
Space
NBA gifs

Note all of the "clunkiness" of the layout is due to my rudimentary design skills. You can actually do a ton of styling on AMP stories via regular CSS so hopefully folks can take this simple foundation and build on it.

## Copy my code github!

Warning - there be dragons. Badly coded dragons. 

Simple styling that let's me do things.

I've tried to both make it simple but flexible. There are some obvious trade offs..

Link to CNN for some of the potential styling and slick layouts.

## Where next?

In summary - I think AMP stories have a long way to go before they feel anywhere near as fluid and fun as Instagram stories. But I'm confident that Google (or someone!) will figure out tappable stories for the web and when they do.... let the fun commence!
