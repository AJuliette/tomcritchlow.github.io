title: Indie Blogging & Distribution
subtitle: You can't divorce content and Distribution
---

I've been thinking a lot about indie blogging recently. The concept of writing on your own platform, or just writing in the fringes of other platforms. Writing with an independent voice.

At least in the circles I frequent there's an undercurrent of dissatisfaction with the fact that the dominant platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Medium) have gobbled up all of the whitespace. They've sucked the energy out of the room for independent voices.

But I simply refuse to buy it. Sure, there are some juggernaut platforms out there - and they control a lot of the web. But the web is a vast sprawling infinite city. Just because you only frequent the regular joints and shop in the malls doesn't mean there aren't thriving subcultures, weird neighborhoods and undiscovered alleyways.

I saw [a tweet storm from Craig Mod](https://twitter.com/craigmod/status/788192542437339136) that give me a jolt of inspiration:

The conversation here naturally turned to how people get their independent voices - only to arrive at the conclusion that TinyLetter (and newsletters in general) have filled a lot of this void.

Then, I saw the newly built Pressthink - [PressThink's new design and third space](http://pressthink.org/2016/10/pressthinks-new-design-third-space/):

>I don’t think indy blogging is done for. No way. More likely it’s due for a re-birth.

And it struck me... You can't divorce content creation from content distribution. We can't rely on Twitter, Facebook or Medium to distribute our content - much as we need to own our platforms we need to also own our own distribution. TinyLetter is one way of doing this - but there are many others.
