title: A Meander Into Architecture
---

After visiting the Canadian Centre for Architecture last month and getting swept away for hours in the process, history and mechanics of architecture. How fascinating the topic of constructing, designing, engineering and thinking about building the environments we live in?

Prior to my trip to the CCA I had never read much about architecture, and so I knew (and still know!) very little about it. So it's been a fun opportunity to think more closely about the architecture of the world that surrounds me and to dive into some interesting nooks and crannies of the internet...

What follow is a collection of interesting links & articles I've found in my wanderings:

[The SAAL Experiment](http://www.uncubemagazine.com/articles/14819879)

The Canadian Centre for Architecture exhibit on SAAL was the thing that kicked off the last month of exploration into architecture so I suppose this has to be the first thing I link to. The notion of architecture as a symbol for revolution is fascinating.

 >Political upheaval leaves cracks in the foundations of a society. But alongside the loss of stability, sometimes radical change (at the end of a fascist regime, for example) also creates a space for radical experimentation – which can require dropping social or professional boundaries and just “doing it together”.

>One such unique project in 1970s Portugal was called SAAL. It may have been short-lived, but it marked a fundamental shift in the evolution of architecture as social practice.

[Archizines - a collection of architecture zines](http://www.archizines.com/)

I want to subsrcibe to every single one of these...

[Soiled - an architecture zine](http://soiledzine.org/)

Found via the above Archizines...

>SOILED is a periodical of architectural stories that makes a mess of the built environment and the politics of space. Our stories are unexpected, accessible, and they instigate mischief! This means a close and serious—and sometimes humorous—examination of the mundane and in-between spaces we inhabit or traverse on a daily basis; a license to boldly, creatively, and irreverently challenge conventional architectural interventions and interpretations.

A constant source of joy in my timeline - Darran Anderson curates and tweets fascinating links about imaginary, real and forgotten architectural spaces. Be sure to buy [Imaginary Cities](http://www.influxpress.com/imaginary-cities/) a book of creative non-fiction around the myths and realities of cities.

>There was a crest of pyrotechnic sparks, and a great cough of steam, and the umbilicals detached from the underside of the building, falling back into the foundation.
>
>Free of its final pinions, the building flexed its arms and stood all the way up.  And, shaking the last of the snow from its shoulders, it began to move, rolling out to the wide road before it.
>
>Behind it, another apartment building shook the snow from its shoulders.  The walking district was awakening.
