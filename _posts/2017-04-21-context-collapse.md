title: Context Collapse, Brands & Content 
subtitle: Why so much content is mediocre and what to do about it.

Context collapse. The idea that the publish box on the internet is terrifyingly broad. With one action we're sending content to people of a million different interests, intents and types.

>Social media technologies collapse multiple audiences into single contexts, making it difficult for people to use the same techniques online that they do to handle multiplicity in face-to-face conversation.

Most content is boring. It has narrative deficiency, term coined by my friend Briand Dell.

Nothing happened to no one for no reason.

You've got to fix all three of those things to make something interesting.

So, how do you fix context collapse. I take all my new media innovation advice from dead authors so I'm gonna turn to John Steinbeck:


Joshua Topolsky agrees with me:


So here's my concise recipe:
 - Define a community of interest
 - Hire an editor in chief with a background in interestingness, preferably in that audience
 - Create content directly for, and with, them.
 - Ensure your brand and positioning allow those members of that community to know this is for them

I've seen too much content marketing start and end with the medium (let's do video! let's do infographics! let's do interactive!) when the real question is not how many eyeballs see your content but rather how many of those eyeballs shed a tear.
