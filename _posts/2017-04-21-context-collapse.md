title: Context Collapse, Brands & Content 
subtitle: Why so much content is mediocre and what to do about it.
---

Context collapse. The idea that the publish box on the internet is terrifyingly broad. With one action we're sending content to people of a million different interests, intents and types.

>Social media technologies collapse multiple audiences into single contexts, making it difficult for people to use the same techniques online that they do to handle multiplicity in face-to-face conversation.

>**The problem is not lack of context. It is context collapse: an infinite number of contexts collapsing upon one another into that single moment of recording**. The images, actions, and words captured by the lens at any moment can be transported to anywhere on the planet and preserved (the performer must assume) for all time. The little glass lens becomes the gateway to a blackhole sucking all of time and space – virtually all possible contexts – in upon itself.

This theory of context collapse applies to individual creators but more-so for brands. Their multiplicity of audiences is terrifying for content creators.

The right lens to see context collapse is the concept of **narrative deficiency** from my good friend [Brian Dell](http://blog.briandell.info/):

**Nothing happened to no one for no reason**

When viewed through this lens almost all branded content is nothing more than transient cheap bad marketing.

## How do you combat Context Collapse?

I take all of my new media innovation advice from dead authors, so here's John Steinbeck:

>Forget your generalized audience. In the first place, the nameless, faceless audience will scare you to death and in the second place, unlike the theater, it doesn’t exist. In writing, your audience is one single reader. I have found that sometimes it helps to pick out one person—a real person you know, or an imagined person and write to that one.

And modern-day-dead-author Joshua Topolsky agrees:

>Compelling voices and stories, real and raw talent, new ideas that actually serve or delight an audience, brands that have meaning and ballast; these are things that matter in the next age of media.[...]
>We’ll have to learn a thousand hard lessons, most of them centered around the idea that if you want to make something really great, you can’t think about making it great for everyone. You have to make it great for someone. A lot of people, but not every person.

Said a different way:

>Whether your employer is a publisher, a brand, or an agency. If you’re making garbage, help them do better. The good ones will listen to you and incorporate your expertise. In my experience, most of them really do want to do it right.
>And believe it or not, super engaged communities often want to hear from the brands who serve them. And super engaged brands want to provide communities with things other than just “content”.
>So if you find yourself writing pablum, narrow the audience to a core group of smart people who care about what the brand has to say. And then convince the brand to say something meaningful to that small, smart audience. Godspeed.

So, how do you fix context collapse. I take all my new media innovation advice from dead authors so I'm gonna turn to John Steinbeck:


Joshua Topolsky agrees with me:


So here's my concise recipe:
 - Define a community of interest
 - Hire an editor in chief with a background in interestingness, preferably in that audience
 - Create content directly for, and with, them.
 - Ensure your brand and positioning allow those members of that community to know this is for them

I've seen too much content marketing start and end with the medium (let's do video! let's do infographics! let's do interactive!) when the real question is not how many eyeballs see your content but rather how many of those eyeballs shed a tear.
