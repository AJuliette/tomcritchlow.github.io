subtitle: The emotional journey of being a freelancer

I've been self-employed & independent for almost exactly 18 months and I wanna talk about it for a second. Maybe I can be helpful to others? Maybe I just need to write.

Being self-employed / freelance[^1] is a lot like going on a road trip. It's exciting, sure, but also brings with it a sense of being untethered, of being a long way from home. Always looking to the horizon and the next rest stop, never stopping to build routines.

## A Fragile Freedom

Don't let me get you down - there are is a large upside to being out on your own. You feel like your time is your own, deadlines are self-enforced and you can take days off without counting them (or getting paid! but that's another story). I've had one of the best years of my life personally and professionally but it's a fragile freedom.

I personally went into this adventure hoping to feel more autonomy and I do - but people aren't joking around when they tell you it's a 7-days-a-week job. After all, it's hard to switch off - there's no protections or abdications of responsibility. You're the boss now.

I've been thinking a lot about untethered work, new ways of working, new forms of helping companies do new things.
