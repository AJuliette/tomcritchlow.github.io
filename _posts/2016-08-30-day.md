title: A Day In the Consultant's Life
subtitle: What do I do all day long?

In my last post on [Intentional Communities](http://tomcritchlow.com/2016/08/25/community/) I got a request from Joshua Hardwick on what a "day in the life of a marketing consultant" looks like.

So here we are. If you're curious what I do generally, head over to my [consulting page](http://tomcritchlow.com/consulting/) which describes some of the things I do for work - but doesn't give much of a sense of what I do day to day. The truth is that it varies wildly, but let's try and give a sense. I've picked two days from the last few weeks, one quiet and one busy to try and outline the extremes.

## Friday

This was a few weeks ago, just as I was about to launch Yes! and... (more on [why I didn't do that here](http://tomcritchlow.com/2016/08/01/brand/)). 

**9am** I headed into the city for a coffee with a friend of a friend who works at a B2B SASS startup here in NYC. Their situation is all too common - they've hit a certain level of scale and success but with very little focus on marketing - so they're looking to bring on their first VP marketing (actually their second - again, a very common story where they cycle through several VP marketing people before finding one they like).

**11am** Back in Brooklyn and working at 61 Local (the best place to get work done during the day in my neighborhood). Of course, by "working" here I'm actually just working on Yes! and - sending the site around to my friends and asking for feedback.

**Noon** Headed to the Y to play some daytime hoops. With work being a little bit slower and nothing on the agenda for Friday afternoon I took the opportunity to get some exercise in. The best advice I've been given about being independent is to make the most of the slow times, when it gets busy there's no time for daytime basketball so make the most of it! I remember I drained a bunch of 3s but kept getting burned by a point guard who was just *better* than me. Highs and lows.

**3pm**
