subtitle: Thoughts from two years being self-employed

Two years ago today I quit my job and headed out on my own as an independent. I'd like to talk about it a little bit. Maybe I can be helpful to those behind me, maybe those in front of me can add their wisdom. Maybe I just need to write.

Being independent is a lot like being on a road trip. Abandoning the social conventions of a secure home, base you set off on an adventure to who-knows-where. There's a feeling of being free, but also of being untethered. Freedom, but untethered, all at once.

I've got a page about [how you can work with me](http://tomcritchlow.com/consulting/) to give you a sense of what I've been up to but here's some more intimate highlights:

- Worked as the interim CMO for startup [Olapic](http://www.olapic.com) - while brief I really enjoyed the chance to flex my mnuscles in a broad marketing role (and congrats to them they were acquired earlier this year!)
- Helped some smaller startups figure out brand positioning & content marketing from scratch.
- Advised the New York Times Cooking site with SEO projects. I'd never been inside the New York Times office and I loved the chance to work with very smart and passionate folks building something from scratch. 
- Had a slow summer in 2015 and didn't work for about three months.
- Worked with a really exciting & innovative content company advising the management team on strategic special projects.
- Took out a coworking space for a year and loved the ability to have a "home" but spent so much time on-site with clients that I decided to get rid of it.
- Worked with Distilled as an advisor and consultant for the NYC office as they rebuilt almost from the ground up.
- Almost built out a dedicated [marketing recruitment business](http://tomcritchlow.com/2016/01/07/team-building/) but eventually got too busy with work and being a dad that I put it on hold. Watch for more on this in 2017. 
- Redesigned my personal site, almost created a brand for my consulting, [but didn't](http://tomcritchlow.com/2016/08/01/brand/).
- Tried to get back into bloging in a more focused way, including a failed experiment in group blogging called [#nycblogclub](http://tomcritchlow.com/2015/09/03/nycblogclub/)
- Oh, and did I mention I had a daughter six months ago?

## A draft positioning statement

Positioning is on my brain right now having just wrapped up a positioning sprint for a client that is really electrifying the organization and helping align decision making. So, all of those experiences above combine to my current **work in progress** positioning statement:

**For content companies looking to invest in growth I'm the secret weapon embedded in your organization to build & lead strategic initiatives**

Let's unpack that one piece at a time:

- *For content companies* - I've got more to write about this but there are different blends of content companies, from traditional media companies like the New York Times or Complex Media (both previous clients) to startups with an editor in chief investing in content to drive inbound marketing & SEO like Fundera (also a previous client).
- *Looking to invest in growth* - This is relatively self obvious, but also aligns around well paid work for optimistic clients.
- *I'm the secret weapon* - Many clients talk of me like a secret weapon, and I like it! It captures the spirit of my unique background that is very hard to find elsewhere to work on unique projects.   
- *Embedded in your organization* - My best work is done face to face on-site with clients, whether for a workshop session or on a retainer basis several days a week. It helps me effect change much better than a traditional agency and, for the hiring work I do, allows me to get a strong sense of culture which is crucial for bringing in new team members.
- *To build and lead new strategic initiatives* - The work I'm most excited about it the kind of work that touches whitespace - new strategic initiatives, building new teams, identifying new areas of growth, strategic insights and so on.

It's only me here, so there's no aligning necessary(!) but it's always useful to be able to articulate what you do. Like I said, it's a work in progress but it's starting to feel good.

## Some Themes From Two Years As An Independent

From all of the above, here's some themes that have emerged so far:

## It takes a while to find your feet

## The network is everything

## Independent but not freelance

## Make it a business

## Be comfortable in your own skin

Not charging by project
Not 

## I love working with content

## Agency work is changing

## SEO is unbundling






## 1. The network is everything

## 2. Invest in yourself

Thanks Dave.

## 3. It's ok to grow slowly, but keep learning

## 4. Lead flow is key

I don't think I realized how much sales was an important skill.

## 5. Align your pricing with the client's value

But don't woryr about pricing on a project basis.

## 6. Get as close to clients as you can

## 7. Don't be afraid to do the dirty work

## 8.
