I've spent the last few weeks building a new identity, brand and website for a my consulting work. But after realizing that this approach was misguided I decided to abandon the new brand and instead consolidate my work on tomcritchlow.com with a new design and direction.

## First, some background

I've been an independent consultant for almost two years - working with large media companies such as The New York Times & Complex Media and working with startups such as Olapic & Fundera. After being out on my own for a while it's about time that I grew up a little and put a more professional brand into the world. So I did some thinking and came up with the brand **Yes! and..**

And then, after building the site and getting ready to launch (I even had a launch blog post written!) decided to abandon it.

## Yes! and... no more

It's a shame to abandon something that you put time and energy into, in particular because this was the first real branding project I've undertaken on my own and I was proud of the results:

In fact for now, the whole site is still online here: [yesand.nyc](http://yesand.nyc)

## The Interesting Bit

When I set out to build my personal brand I didn't really know why I wanted to have a distinct brand - sure I needed to form an LLC and I enjoyed the challenge of building a new visual identity and coding a new website. But none of that got me closer to *why* I was doing this in the first place. The truth is if I'd stopped to ask myself that at the beginning of my project I'm not sure I would have known the answer. It took the merry go round of doing the work to actually understand what I was doing in the first place. That's an important lesson.

## The Great Challenge of Personal Branding

Personal branding, especially for (gasp!) a marketing consultant is terrifying. How do I escape being that douchey arrogant person while still appearing professional and capable of well paid work? How do I avoid putting a ferrari or a photo of me skydiving on my about page?! (The answer it turns out is remarkably easy - you just don't put a photo of skydiving or ferrari-driving on the about page).

But you have to balance that against the personal nature of the work that I do. People aren't hiring Yes! and... - they're hiring Tom Critchlow. And the simpler and more direct I can make that the more genuine this will feel. Ultimately all I need to do is be true to myself (sometimes this is hard to do though!)

## Here's Where I'm Going

So after all this - I ripped the design right out of yesand, put a new tomcritchlow.com live and I'm doubling down on the following core ideas:

- This site must reflect me. That means there's a photo of my face on the homepage and I talk about the work that I do, but it's also a little quirky and creative (and green!). And I might meander into art or architecture from time to time.
- In order to get good clients I'm going to need to expose a little more about the work that I do. Look out for a few case studies, and more under the hood posts on my consulting work in the future. For the moment, [start here](/consulting).
- It's valuable to try and build a community. This translates into three things; I'm going to be posting here more regularly, I've integrated Disqus comments on the site for more dialogue and I'm launching a newsletter ([sign up](http://tinyletter.com/tomcritchlow)!).

## What Do You Think?

Part of the intentional focus here is to build a small engaged community so let me know. What do you think about the new brand? Have you struggled with personal branding?
