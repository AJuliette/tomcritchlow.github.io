Hello 2015. It's been a while since we've seen each other.

Welcome to my redesigned blog. Hosted on Github pages using Jeckyll.

I'm going to be (aspring to) write more here, now that I have a place to put my writing that I feel happy with. I've been resolving the problem of HAVING A BLOG by seamlessly mixing my tomcritchlow.com blogging with other writing I do elsewhere, be it Medium, the NYTimes (haha, wouldn't that be nice) or elsewhere.

Much love - if you have something you'd like to see me write about just get in touch.

Tom xx
