This morning, fresh off a call with a client who's building a new online community from scratch I wanted to find a good "beginner's guide to community" or similar. I tweeted out this:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Anyone have a suggestion for a &quot;beginners guide to building a community&quot; or a &quot;community blueprint&quot; on the web?</p>&mdash; Tom Critchlow (@tomcritchlow) <a href="https://twitter.com/tomcritchlow/status/871742200513691648">June 5, 2017</a></blockquote>
