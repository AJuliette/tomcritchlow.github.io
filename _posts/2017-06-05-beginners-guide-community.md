subtitle: A roundup of links and guides for thinking about and building communities online.

This morning, fresh off a call with a client who's building a new online community from scratch I wanted to find a good "beginner's guide to community" or similar. I tweeted out this:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Anyone have a suggestion for a &quot;beginners guide to building a community&quot; or a &quot;community blueprint&quot; on the web?</p>&mdash; Tom Critchlow (@tomcritchlow) <a href="https://twitter.com/tomcritchlow/status/871742200513691648">June 5, 2017</a></blockquote>

The responses were frankly amazing. I think I struck a vein somehow? Below is a roundup of all the amazing and fascinating links I received:

**The community canvas**

>What is the Community Canvas? It is a framework that will help you build a community, analyze a community or improve an existing community.

With guides, worksheets, a visual summary and a full 61-page guidebook this looks about as close to the "ultimate guide" that I've seen.

**Feverbee**

Rich Millington of Feverbee has been writing and thinking about communities for a looong time and he's got some gems.

The ultimate guide to building an online community from 2013 looks like a comprehensive resource:

And, his strategic community management piece looks very exec friendly too:

>Tired of chasing elusive higher engagement metrics? Struggling to prioritize your work? Not sure what to measure or what will have the biggest impact? This comprehensive guide to community strategy will help you understand and approach your community strategically.

**CMXhub Community Canvas**

Another canvas (what's with all the community canvases? just alliteration?). This is pretty high level but again, another useful exec friendly one page format:

>The Community Strategy Canvas is laid out in three levels:
>Alignment is where you think high-level about why your community exists, what the goals are, who members are, and the culture youâ€™ll create.
>Development is where you plan out how you will actually build and measure your community.
>Management is the infrastructure that creates an environment for your community team to succeed within your organization.
