title: The Consultant's Grain
subtitle: Musings on strategy, culture and how to effect change within organizations which are inherently biased. How do you change against the grain? How do you recognize your own grain?

You would think that being a consultant is easy. Clients hire you to help change their company in some way. You make some recommendations and provide some insights and then...

The change rarely happens like you recommended.

Why is that? Well, we think consulting is:

*analysis -> insight -> recommendation -> review -> implementation*

At best this is too simple, at worst it's flat out wrong. Just like every other framework for thinking about strategy and change they only scratch the surface of what's really going on.

My experience with successful consulting is that the best work is done close enough to smell the client, with an emotional understanding of the users, a constant feedback loop of prototypes and long term campaigning for the big change you want to see.

## A primer on effecting change: the consultant's toolkit

Let's first take a look at the tools of the trade. Documents.

There is the pyramid of mediums - https://www.distilled.net/resources/better-business-documents-guide/

This can be helpful - if you're thinking about the kind of change you're hoping to see you can choose the right document type. But it's only scratching the surface of what's really going on. It'll also artificially limit you.

This will help you create work that's closer to the finished product that you're trying to change. That's a good thing. But still doesn't answer a central question - who are we trying to convince?


## Of course, it's humans all the way down

So the most effective tools are those that deal with humans:

- Workshops
- User interviews
- Working on site


Get close enough to smell the clients

Spend time with them. Workshop.

## Consulting Fast & Slow

Campaign for change. Grassroots change.

In my own work I enjoy having "hard" and "soft" skills and combining them in a way to enable me to add immediate short term value to projects (like content strategy or SEO audits) which buys me enough time to stick around long enough to campaign for change like new brands, new business models, acquisitions, teams and more.

WHy blogging is effective. You're not looking for sign off, you're looking for followers. Belivers.

When I was working at Google I recall there were projects I tried to get off the ground but ultimately failed to do. One in particular was a slack-like 

The other was an idea to 

Both ideas got shut down by executives and saw little distribution.

Contrast that to the kind of change you can have with a well written memo that is designed to be easy to circulate.

But what does **easy to circulate** mean for you? Mostly I encourage people to think of this as blogging.

## The Crux: Companies have a grain.

Cutting against the grain is hard and messy. There's too much friction.

Instead you're more effective cutting with the grain.

## The Consultant Has Bias Too

Which brings me to the title of this piece.

Being a consultant is, in essence, an exercise in effecting change. Clients hire me to make some kind of change within their business. And, b


I also propose some new forms - why workshops don't work. Why we should be understanding problems before chasing solutions but creating fast MVPs that are real enough to get behind.

The consultant's grain.

The typical heirarchy is decks - documents - data

My favorite way to deliver consulting? Screenshots. Fiddling with pages in code, showing how it feels in the browser. There's something powerful there. All of my failed recommendations.

A story of blogging inside Google. -> many good consultants are strong writers.

Understand that you're working against a mindset. Entrenched opinions and ideas. Ways of thinking.

What consulting looks like.

On Documents

new Documents
mockups & code

Beyond documents - affecting change
workshops
smellling the clients problems
slack / basecamp

Plugging leaks
 - example SEO reporting spreadsheet
 - outreach to hiring folks
 - 

Working with the client's grain
- you can't put lipstick on a pig
- the benign consultant

Sniffing clients. Getting close enough to smell them.

Basic thesis - you need a humanities interest and diverse background, fluent in people and data and comfortable using powerpoint, doc and excel, but let's add a new one - code and design. I.e. prototypes.

New ideas, directions and concepts bleed out across organizations. They don't come out of nowhere but equally no ideas ever really die. They become assimilated into the knowledge of the organization.
