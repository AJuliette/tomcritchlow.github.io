title: The Consultant's Grain
subtitle: Culture eats strategy for breakfast. So what does effective strategy look like within an organizations culture? In short it starts with recognizing which recommendations go with or against the grain of the organization.
---

You would think that being a consultant is easy. Clients hire you to help change their company in some way. You make some recommendations and provide some insights and then...

The change rarely happens like you recommended.

Why is that? Well, we think consulting is:

*analysis -> insight -> recommendation -> review -> implementation*

At best this is too simple, at worst it's flat out wrong. The problem is just below the surface - you're hired to change their company *in a way they've so far been unable to change*. That simple addition starts to help us understand the complexity and challenges of "consulting" or "strategy".

In summary - the kwy to effective consulting is to first understand the culture within the organization that resisted this change. And then recognize that you can certainly have small wins but change "against the grain" of the culture takes a long time and requires changing people's beliefs at scale.

We're just scratching the surface here though. Read on to get deeper down this rabbithole.

## A primer on effecting change: the consultant's toolkit

First things first let's take a look at some basics. When you're trying to make change it's important to understand what kind of change you're looking for and choosing the appropriate tool for the job. Pretty much everything I know about effective consulting I learned from my brother and he wrote a nice piece on [better business documents](https://www.distilled.net/resources/better-business-documents-guide/) where he outlines the pyramid of documents.

I always try and follow this model and will switch between formats and medium often during a consulting engagement depending on the work. For example - here's a taste of the range of work produced during a single client engagement (some work I did for the New York Times Cooking site a few years back).

This can be helpful - especially if you explicitly take the time to really think through who your audience is for a given recommendation and think about what medium will suit it best (sometimes multiple mediums!).

But this is only scratching the surface.

## The New Consultant's Toolkit - Mockups & Prototypes

While the above framework is useful, recently I've found that I can be far more effective by getting closer to the output. What do I mean by that? Well - documents are almost never the actual output we're looking for. Usually we're looking for teams to be hired, or landing pages to be made or videos to be shot etc.

The modern web is such a remixable medium that I urge you to think how you can build an MVP or prototype of the change you're recommending. The most simple way to do this is using inspect element in chrome to change up a site and then take a screenshot. Being able to see language, design and formats in play within the very medium we're discussing can be very effective. Here's a screenshot of a prototype I built for a client to demonstrate an idea:

![](/images/fmt.png)

There are a million different tools to generate mockups and prototypes (which is the beauty!) but my goto tools are:

- Chrome's inspect element for small changes and tweaks (protip you can take mobile mockups this way too using the device switcher, and even add a device frame to the screenshot too)
- Google slides for mockups and more design-focused work. [Read more about how I do that here](https://medium.com/@tomcritchlow/how-to-use-google-slides-as-a-free-cloud-hosted-illustrator-replacement-f472e6c3a881.
- [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) for functioning prototypes and 

This approach will help you get closer to producing recommendations and ideas that resemble the finished product, that's a good thing. But it still doesn't answer the central question - who are we trying to convince?

## Of course, it's humans all the way down

So the most effective tools are those that deal with humans:

- Workshops
- User interviews
- Working on site


Get close enough to smell the clients

Spend time with them. Workshop.

## Consulting Fast & Slow

Campaign for change. Grassroots change.

In my own work I enjoy having "hard" and "soft" skills and combining them in a way to enable me to add immediate short term value to projects (like content strategy or SEO audits) which buys me enough time to stick around long enough to campaign for change like new brands, new business models, acquisitions, teams and more.

WHy blogging is effective. You're not looking for sign off, you're looking for followers. Belivers.

When I was working at Google I recall there were projects I tried to get off the ground but ultimately failed to do. One in particular was a slack-like 

The other was an idea to 

Both ideas got shut down by executives and saw little distribution.

Contrast that to the kind of change you can have with a well written memo that is designed to be easy to circulate.

But what does **easy to circulate** mean for you? Mostly I encourage people to think of this as blogging.

## The Crux: Companies have a grain.

Cutting against the grain is hard and messy. There's too much friction.

Instead you're more effective cutting with the grain.

## The Consultant Has Bias Too

Which brings me to the title of this piece.

Being a consultant is, in essence, an exercise in effecting change. Clients hire me to make some kind of change within their business. And, b


I also propose some new forms - why workshops don't work. Why we should be understanding problems before chasing solutions but creating fast MVPs that are real enough to get behind.

The consultant's grain.

The typical heirarchy is decks - documents - data

My favorite way to deliver consulting? Screenshots. Fiddling with pages in code, showing how it feels in the browser. There's something powerful there. All of my failed recommendations.

A story of blogging inside Google. -> many good consultants are strong writers.

Understand that you're working against a mindset. Entrenched opinions and ideas. Ways of thinking.

What consulting looks like.

On Documents

new Documents
mockups & code

Beyond documents - affecting change
workshops
smellling the clients problems
slack / basecamp

Plugging leaks
 - example SEO reporting spreadsheet
 - outreach to hiring folks
 - 

Working with the client's grain
- you can't put lipstick on a pig
- the benign consultant

Sniffing clients. Getting close enough to smell them.

Basic thesis - you need a humanities interest and diverse background, fluent in people and data and comfortable using powerpoint, doc and excel, but let's add a new one - code and design. I.e. prototypes.

New ideas, directions and concepts bleed out across organizations. They don't come out of nowhere but equally no ideas ever really die. They become assimilated into the knowledge of the organization.
