title: The Consultant's Grain
subtitle: Musings on strategy, culture and how to effect change within organizations which are inherently biased. How do you change against the grain? How do you recognize your own grain?

You would think that being a consultant is easy... Clients hire you to help change their company in some way. You make some recommendations and provide some insights and then...

The change rarely happens like you recommended.

Why is that? Well, we think consulting is:

*analysis -> recommendation -> review -> implementation*

At best this is too simple, at worst it's flat out wrong.

## The Consultant Has Bias Too

Which brings me to the title of this piece.

Being a consultant is, in essence, an exercise in effecting change. Clients hire me to make some kind of change within their business. And, b

Abstract: my experience with successful consulting is that the best work is done close enough to smell the client, with an emotional understanding of the users and a constant feedback loop of prototypes.

I also propose some new forms - why workshops don't work. Why we should be understanding problems before chasing solutions but creating fast MVPs that are real enough to get behind.

The consultant's grain.

The typical heirarchy is decks - documents - data

My favorite way to deliver consulting? Screenshots. Fiddling with pages in code, showing how it feels in the browser. There's something powerful there. All of my failed recommendations.

A story of blogging inside Google. -> many good consultants are strong writers.

Understand that you're working against a mindset. Entrenched opinions and ideas. Ways of thinking.

What consulting looks like.

On Documents

new Documents
mockups & code

Beyond documents - affecting change
workshops
smellling the clients problems
slack / basecamp

Plugging leaks
 - example SEO reporting spreadsheet
 - outreach to hiring folks
 - 

Working with the client's grain
- you can't put lipstick on a pig
- the benign consultant

Sniffing clients. Getting close enough to smell them.

Basic thesis - you need a humanities interest and diverse background, fluent in people and data and comfortable using powerpoint, doc and excel, but let's add a new one - code and design. I.e. prototypes.

New ideas, directions and concepts bleed out across organizations. They don't come out of nowhere but equally no ideas ever really die. They become assimilated into the knowledge of the organization.
