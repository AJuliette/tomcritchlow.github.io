Abstract: my experience with successful consulting is that the best work is done close enough to smell the client, with an emotional understanding of the users and a constant feedback loop of prototypes.

I also propose some new forms - why workshops don't work. Why we should be understanding problems before chasing solutions but creating fast MVPs that are real enough to get behind.

We think consulting is:
analysis -> recommendation -> review -> implementation
