Being a consultant is, in essence, an exercise in effecting change. Clients hire me to make some kind of change within their business. And, b

Abstract: my experience with successful consulting is that the best work is done close enough to smell the client, with an emotional understanding of the users and a constant feedback loop of prototypes.

I also propose some new forms - why workshops don't work. Why we should be understanding problems before chasing solutions but creating fast MVPs that are real enough to get behind.

The consultant's grain.

The typical heirarchy is decks - documents - data

My favorite way to deliver consulting? Screenshots. Fiddling with pages in code, showing how it feels in the browser. There's something powerful there. All of my failed recommendations.

A tale of successful implemented page template for client

A story of blogging inside Google. -> many good consultants are strong writers.

Understand that you're working against a mindset. Entrenched opinions and ideas. Ways of thinking.

What consulting looks like.

On Documents

new Documents
mockups & code

Beyond documents - affecting change
workshops
smellling the clients problems

We think consulting is:
analysis -> recommendation -> review -> implementation

But at best this is too simple, at worst it's flat out wrong.

New ideas, directions and concepts bleed out across organizations. They don't come out of nowhere but equally no ideas ever really die. They become assimilated into the knowledge of the organization.
