title: A Day In the Consultant's Life
subtitle: What do I do all day long?

In my last post on [Intentional Communities](http://tomcritchlow.com/2016/08/25/community/) I got a request from Joshua Hardwick on what a "day in the life of a marketing consultant" looks like.

So here we are. If you're curious what I do generally, head over to my [consulting page](http://tomcritchlow.com/consulting/) which describes some of the things I do for work - but doesn't give much of a sense of what I do day to day. The truth is that it varies wildly, but let's try and give a sense. I've picked two days from the last few weeks, one quiet and one busy to try and outline the extremes.

## Friday

## Monday
