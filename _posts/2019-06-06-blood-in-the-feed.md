Have you had the feeling of being prey inside an algorithmic system?

Maybe this is common behaviour - but I recently clicked an Instagram ad ([yes, I have a new watch](https://www.skagen.com/en-us/aaren-kulor-neon-green-silicone-41mm-watch-skw6556) - it's very on brand for my blog).

I don't click ads often, in fact I can't remember the last time I did but.

But ever since clicking the watch ad my feed is populated exclusively by watch ads. So many watch ads. There's an uneasy feeling of the algorithmic sharks circling in the water, they smell blood. A weakness in the user.

There's blood in the feed and the algorithms can smell it.

I took screenshots of all the ones I rememberd to.

Of course, I'm certain at least some of these watches barely exist - as per the magnificent investigation by Jenny Odell in her research report [There's no such thing as a free watch](http://www.jennyodell.com/free-watch.html).

The opposite of blood in the feed is algorithmic whiplash - a sense of dislocation that comes from the algorithm trying to guess whether you're interested in RBA rates or a UFC fight. This sense of unreal disbelief - how can you get things so wrong?
