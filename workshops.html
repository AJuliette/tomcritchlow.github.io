    <h2 class="f3 f2-l fw3 lh-copy center">Ideas in Motion</h2>

<div>Hi there, I offer workshops (aka “ideas in motion”) as an offering to engage together.
    They’re good for me and they’re good for you and I’m looking to increase the number of workshops I do in 2018
    Who is this for: companies looking to create clarity and alignment around key marketing & growth initiatives.

        <div class="fl w-100 w-third-l">
        <h2>1) Align on 2-3 key challenges</h2>
        Its useful to focus our objectives on some specific challenges.

        <div class="fl w-100 w-third-l">
        <h2>2) Pre-work touchpoints</h2>
        Before we get together it's useful to connect and align on some directions for the workshop, make sure some of my assumptions are valid and so on.
        </div>

        <div class="fl w-100 w-third-l">
        <h2>3) Research & Preparation</h2>
        Every workshop requires some research and prep work. I tend to dive into a couple specific things to try and bring something provocative to the workshop.

        <h2>4) Agenda & Schedule</h2>
        Planning.

        <h2>5) Workshop!</h2>
        Do the thing

        <div class="fl w-100 w-third-l">
            <h2>6) Debrief & Followup</h2>
            During the workshop we create shared docs and notes but the debrief is useful to make sure we take away the right insights and to discuss ways of taking it forward once the ideas settle.

<h1>The Tensions of Modern Marketing</h1>
<div class="">Every business I work with seems to currently struggle along these tensions:</div>

<div class="w-two-thirds-l fl f3">
    In the distributed and social world we live in there’s a tension between brands, who specialize in user acquisition, user insights and monetization. And media companies, who specialize in editorial, narrative, story and (often) purpose.

Brands lack distribution and interestingness

Media companies lack user insights, or a notion of branding.

(And there’s a middle grey area of affiliate businesses that generate content at the scale of media properties but are more savvy on the commercials while being less editorially interesting).

<div class="w-two-thirds-l fl f3">
    When was the last time the VP of Brand spoke to the VP of growth?

    Brand marketing (and brand marketers) excel at positioning a brand into something relevant. But they lack the data fluency and action-oriented mindset of a growth team.
    
    Activities like paid acquisition, SEO and content marketing often fall under the leadership of data driven marketers, while the brand is somewhere else trying to move a different set of KPIs.
    
    But in today’s world we reach users in a diverse set of always-on channels and need brand and performance to work in unison.
