title: wikinote?

I think this is what I want:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47349194/is-it-possible-to-loop-over-subfolders-in-jekyll

Loop over static pages within folders - allows me to mix and match .md notes and images in a single folder.

Or maybe something here?

Maybe here?

https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/920

Build a menu at the wiki root here:

Also - for each folder I think I want the index.html the same with a single reference perhaps? Prevent cognitive overhead when generating new folders?

My drafts should just be a folder in my wiki. That way they're open access.

How to add comments? Hypothesis? Hmm.
