>You can take this course after having read Loonshots or in real-time while you read it. Each chapter has a section below, each with additional resources - youtube videos, podcasts, blog posts and articles - and each section ends with a quiz. The quizzes are there to help you make sure that you’ve locked the information in. 

In addition to reading the book, the course should take about 8-10 hours to complete, including reading, watching and listening to the additional resources and taking the quizzes.  I hope that you find it to be time well-spent. If you complete the course, including the final assignment, I will send you a Loonshots Diploma:
