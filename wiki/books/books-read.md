title: A running list of books I've finished
books:
 - title: Way Station
   author: Clifford D. Simak
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Way-Station-Clifford-D-Simak-ebook/dp/B00YO78RRS
   date_finished: 8/25/19
   notes: Lovely vintage sci-fi recommended by Chris Butler. There's aliens, teleporting and... magic? But nothing flashy happens - it's an incredibly human story. This is a really thoughtful and fresh story. Highly recommended.
 - title: Idiots First
   author: Bernard Malamud
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Idiots-First-Bernard-Malamud/dp/0374174202
   date_finished: 8/15/19
   notes: The opening line of Idiot's First is a masterpiece. 'The thin ticking of the tin clock stopped'. Loved a few of the other stories but some were definitely forgettable. I'd recommend dipping your toe in and at the very least reading the title story Idiots First.
 - title: The Scar
   author: China Mi√©ville
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Scar-China-Mi%C3%A9ville/dp/0345460014
   date_finished: 08/06/19
   notes: Ah what delicious sludgy, dark, human texture. China Mi√©ville's descriptive language and world building is unparalleled. This is book two (after reading Perdido Street Station last year). These books are long and luxurious so perhaps not the best entry point if you're new to his writing but if you like this kind of thing there's nothing better. My only quarrel with this book was the ending... It felt somewhat unsatisfying, or rather unfinished - where a typical book resolves this felt like the open sea was still in front of you? But it's a very minor comment as mostly the strength of this book was that every page told a lifetime of texture. Definitely going to read book three of this trilogy after a break.
 - title: Last Night
   author: James Salter
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Last-Night-Stories-James-Salter/dp/1400078415
   date_finished: 07/14/19
   notes: After reading All That Is I had to wash my palette and get back to some of his delicious writing. This was much more in line with Light Years and contained some lovely moments. None of the short stories will linger with me too long but it's a short read and I'd recommend it.
 - title: Emissaries Guide to Worlding
   author: Ian Cheng
   link: https://serpentine-galleries.myshopify.com/products/coming-soon-ian-cheng-emissaries-guide-to-worlding
   notes: The core idea of the masks - the cartoonist, the director, the hacker and the emissary - is wonderful and a new lens to look at the world through, so overall I'd recommend the book. But there was also an incredible over-indulgence from the author to live inside his own worlds (which feels very finite game like, not infinite game like). And the lack of people anywhere in his worlds is also problematic. That said - the book as an object is beautiful and wonderfully designed.

 - title: The Prisoner
   author: Thomas M. Disch
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Prisoner-Novel-Thomas-M-Disch/dp/014311722X
   notes: I really enjoyed this - a delightfully British story of being trapped, like a combination of Kafka and PG Wodehouse. The plot derailed itself in a few places and there was a whole Shakespere reference that kind of went over my head but the writing was wonderful. Recommended.
   date_finished: 7/7/19
 - title: Oval
   author: Elvia Wilk
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Oval-Novel-Elvia-Wilk/dp/1593764057
   date_finished: 6/24/19
   notes: I really loved this. Distinctive, fresh writing that captures so much of the present weirdness in society while also somehow feeling timeless. The middle third dragged slightly for me but the descent into ecological weird towards the end is just wonderful and reminds me of the Annihiliation series by Jeff Vandermeer. Oh and the whole book centers on this premise of artists becoming 'consultants' which is magnificent. Recommended. Verdict- üëçüå≤
 - title: All That Is
   author: James Salter
   link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007WKFMGS
   date_finished: 06/09/2019
   notes: A wildly disappointing read. Not that it was so bad but that having recently read Light Years I was expecting so much more. There were moments of brilliance in the writing and some of the scenes will linger with me overall the book didn't really make me feel anything. Definitely read Light Years instead.
 - title: Borderless
   author: Eliot Peper
   link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BM7F9SF
   date_finished: 5/20/2019
   notes: Book two of the Analog series. Overall I connected less with the main character in this one but connected more with the overall premise which is very thought provoking. It feels today that we are actively living through the end (or at least a phase transition) of sovereignty. Compelling and a quick read.
 - title: Bandwidth
   author: Eliot Peper
   link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075CLV95J/
   date_finished: 5/13/2019
   notes: I completely devoured this book. The characters and pace keeps it flowing but the ideas will stick with me - it's grounded in a very near future and the concepts are well thought through. Excited to keep diving into Borderless next.
 - title: The Gone Away World
   author: Nick Harkaway
   link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001EL6R9W/
   date_finished: 5/07/2019
   notes: A majestic feat of imagination - whirlwind story of a gong-fu epic in a world gone mad. Definitely feels like it needed better editing or structuring and was about 100 pages too long but the strength of imagination and grasp of poetry really captivated me. Picked this up off the street on the way home from kung-fu training (approriate!). I'll be reading more of his work.
 - title: Light Years
   author: James Salter
   link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004G8PIOA/
   date_finished: 4/12/2019
   notes: This book completely destroyed me. The writing is dense and poetic like almost no one I've ever read. Did you know glass is a liquid and slowly 'flows'? This book operates on a time horizon and 'flows' through lives in a deeply transformative way. Found via <a href='https://www.gyford.com/phil/writing/2019/02/15/light-years-james-salter/'>Phil Gyford</a>
 - title: Delirious New York
   author: Rem Koolaas
   link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JYVYUUW/
   date_finished: 3/18/2019
   notes: It's architecture writing but lyrical, magical and opinionated. A tour de force through New York's history with tons of interesting characters, ideas, explorations and more. Ideas include congestion as an organizing principle of the city, and every block being an archipelago. Wonderful and highly recommended.
 - title: Tomorrow In The Battle Think On Me
   author: Javier Marias
   link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/0307950751 
   date_finished: 2/17/2019
   notes: Abandoned. I think somewhere in this book is buried a wonderful treasure. The looping self-aware story is fundamentally interesting and new but the language that wraps around it chokes it to death. Abandoned about half way through.
 - title: Summerland
   author: Hannu Rajaniemi
   link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0756K1Q8D/
   date_finished: 1/21/2019
   notes: A wonderful original work - full of interesting characters. Ghosts! Spys! Old London! Really enjoyed this and tore through it super fast.
 - title: Finite & Infinite Games
   author: James Carse
   link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004W3FM4A/
   date_finished: 1/10/2019
   notes: Great unique book, wonderful analogy to finite and infinite writing....
 - title: The Power
   author: Naomi Alderman
   link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N0Z1EY0
   date_finished: 12/30/2018
   notes: Provocative premise but I felt it squandered an opportunity at a deeper political and/or emotional exploration of what would happen if teenage girls gained a new incredible power. Somehow it resorted to.... fucking and fighting?
 - title: Perdido Street Station
   author: China Mieville
   link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FBFO8C/
   date_finished: 12/01/2018
   notes: A staggering, creative, filthy, engrossing tour through a world with such magical and rich depths. No one can build worlds like China.
 - title: Satin Island
   author: Tom McCarthy
   link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MZWA678/
   date_finished: 03/21/2018
   notes: William Gibson meets Kafka. A corporate strategy consultant / ethnographer ponders the meaning of life and searches for the Great Report.
 - title: The Dark Dark
   author: Samantha Hunt
   link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N0TDSVM/
   date_finished: 02/15/2018
   notes: Tender, oozing, lyrical, dark, DARK stories of being human. Did I mention they are dark? What writing though! What imagination!
