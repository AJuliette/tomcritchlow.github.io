Delerious new york by Rem Koolhaus - recommended by Jarrett Fuller.

Milkman - recc by All my stars: "I finished Milkman after the holiday. It is not just a great novel, it is a great 21st century novelâ€”a book that could hold its own on a list including literature over the course of a hundred years. I miss reading it. I hope everyone checks it out, because even if it's not for you, it is good to see what a novel can do and can be in 2019 (well, 2018.)"
