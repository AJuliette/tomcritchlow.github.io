## Diagrams and Doodles

How do diagrams and doodling fit into strategy consulting? They're related and adjacent. I believe doodling and diagrams are good practice for creating **frameworks**. See my post here for more on that:

Below are some interesting diagrams, doodlers and examples I've collected. Hopefully I'll keep this updated:


### Venkatesh Rao of Ribbonfarm fame

Venkatesh has tons. Drawings, doodles, diagrams, flows and more. Some faves:

### Mark Pollard

All the good stuff is on Instagram: [@markpollard](https://www.instagram.com/markpollard/?hl=en)

###  Nahee cyberdiagrams (nsfw)

The best instagram account I follow. Hands down.

Imagine a venn diagram of cyberfeminism, erotica, developer manuals, code and art. Mildly NSFW:

### Hugh MacLeod

Ex-ad-agency starts doodling on business cards. Gets good. Becomes famous. Turns doodling into a strategy consulting firm. Magic.

### Wardly Maps

Related to the frameworks and diagrams idea is the notion of "wayfinding" in strategy. Most famously Wardly Maps. More on that here:

And there's a fun tool to build your own here:

### Misc

[Maps of the mind](https://twitter.com/pieratt/status/1143183857925152768) looks *delicious*.

Good deck of visual slides from Julian Cole [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oI91JTOIk4uZ36aXCCBWiSpYWFnSndQO5RRN8Txg2bc/edit#slide=id.g5543296f87_0_2519)

>But beyond their two-dimensional depictions of a physical world, maps also afford us the freedom to express the cosmos; to make all kinds of ideas about the spatial relationships of multiple components unexpectedly clear. To draw one is an effective way to establish order on an otherwise chaotic environment. To make it navigable. To make it rational.

>In one of the classes I teach at CCA, students were confused by mental models, conceptual models, concept maps, etc. I ended up drawing a taxonomy for models on the whiteboard, and it may help others.
