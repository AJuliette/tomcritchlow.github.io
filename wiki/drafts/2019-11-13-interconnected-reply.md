It's fun when you bump into fellow travelers on the road... Matt Webb has been on his own journey for the past five years and [wrote up some thoughts](http://interconnected.org/home/2019/11/13/mwie).

Congrats on making it this far Matt!

>Let’s call it product discovery and market discovery. Business-speak as camouflage for feelings.


>That last point all about what we’d call in other contexts product-market fit. That hyphen is an arrow of influence that points both ways.

Marketing requires a view on what the market finds valuable; what will resonate. In my case, how clients will find and understand business value. Not only have I lacked up-to-date knowledge of what value I, personally, can unlock, but prematurely working on marketing will shape the product before it’s ready.

And what is the “product” here? Well it’s me, my practice — it’s some overlap of what I find stimulating, what I’m good at, and what helps me get future work which is the same but better. But can I articulate that? Not a chance.
