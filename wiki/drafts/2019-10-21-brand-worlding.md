title: Understanding Marketing Realities
subtitle: How to survey the digital landscape and get better experience data

I have a fundamental belief that the human brain is ill-suited to understanding the hyper-scale realities of digital media. The size, speed and fragmented realities of digital media astound and confound our basic ideas of scale, shared reality and culture.

In short, we struggle to see "how things work".

We see this manifest in many ways. But one way is the retreat to data - a retreat from reality to measurable aggregation. Counting likes rather than measuring influence. Counting pageviews rather than understanding intent.

I get it. And I'm guilty of it too. We all are.

So where to? Here's some trends I'm seeing as brand further decentralize and decohere.

Of course, every measure is an approximation and every model is wrong (though some are useful).

## Experience Data

Lindsay Slaby frames this trend well here - with the phrase "experience data". I.e. how do you close the gap between what you *think* your audience is experiencing vs what they *actually* experience.

One way to do this is via an ethnographic study of your audiences and their lived experience with your ads. This [detailed case study from friends Part & Sum](https://medium.com/part-and-sum/modern-mystery-shopping-glossier-580d6563ef22) is a wonderful peek into how you might do this:

>Each persona was assigned a series of actions to be performed on the Glossier website, its social accounts and search engines. Then, with ad blockers disabled, shoppers documented all Glossier content they saw for the next two weeks: emails, ads, suggested posts and so on.

>Of our six shoppers, two saw no Glossier targeted ads or social posts at all. Of the remaining four, only one saw any display ads. These four saw several sponsored posts on Instagram and Facebook.
