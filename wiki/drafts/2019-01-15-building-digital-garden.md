For a while I've been searching for better ways of managing my information flows. Catch up by reading my last post [of digital streams, campfires and gardens](https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/10/10/of-gardens-and-wikis/).

I left that post with the following concept:

**Streams** - For me this is twitter and is more than enough stream for now.

**Campfires** - For me this is the blog here (and more broadly the blogosphere that I read and engage with). Room to grow here but generally I'm satisfied here.

**Gardens** - This is where there's a gap for me personally. No place to store and evolve deeper longer-term thinking. Many of my friends have gravitated to [https://are.na](Are.na) but I just can't get it to work for me.

For my personal garden (note: your requirements and needs might be different!) I set out to build something that would focus on [stock over flow](http://snarkmarket.com/2010/4890), be [a blogging product without a publish button](https://twitter.com/ryandawidjan/status/1077641141221249031) and create a space for collecting the dots.

Let's break those down one by one:

## Stock over flow

If you're familiar with this blog then the chances are high that you've read this seminal piece from Robin Sloan: [stock and flow](http://snarkmarket.com/2010/4890). Robin lays out (in 2010!) the concept of stock and flow:

> Flow is the feed. It’s the posts and the tweets. It’s the stream of daily and sub-daily updates that reminds people you exist.

> Stock is the durable stuff. It’s the content you produce that’s as interesting in two months (or two years) as it is today. It’s what people discover via search. It’s what spreads slowly but surely, building fans over time.

And is clear not to deride flow - it's the currency of the modern world - but rather to ensure you're well-balanced:

> You can tell that I want you to stop and think about stock here. I feel like we all got really good at flow, really fast. But flow is ephemeral, while stock sticks around. Stock is capital. Stock is protein.

> And the real magic trick is to put them both together. To keep the ball bouncing with your flow—to maintain that open channel of communication—while you work on some kick-ass stock in the background. Sacrifice neither. The hybrid strategy.

Personally? I'm out of balance. I spend too much time in flow and not nearly enough in stock.

What do I want from a digital garden?

1) Stock not flow

2) No publish button

3) Long-term focused

4) Simple!

The solution I settled on I think covers most of these (though could also be improved on all of them).

So I set out to build something that would solve the problems of [stock & flow](http://snarkmarket.com/2010/4890), [a blogging product without a publish button](https://twitter.com/ryandawidjan/status/1077641141221249031) and a digital garden. Let's unpack those one by one:

## Longevity, text files and folders

The realization that started this project was thinking about publishing in triplicate - an idea I've thought of a few times on the power of my blog. When I publish an article it's published to 

## Creativity is about collecting the dots

The phrase "connecting the dots" is much more commonly used but the truth is that creativity begins by collecting the dots before you can connect them. And no, just consuming media is not "collecting" anything.

>But ideas aren’t summoned from nowhere: they come from raw material, other ideas or observations about the world. Hence a two-step creative process: collect raw material, then think about it. From this process comes pattern recognition and eventually the insights that form the basis of novel ideas.

## Some other interesting wikis

https://buster.wiki/ - too structured for my personal taste? Strong design though (and has a latest updated feed which, for now, I've intentionally not built in)

Creativity lies in research (the slow hunch). Collecting.

Digital garden.

Turns out folders are the right way 

Hacking jekyll using folders and files. It lives on Github pages but could be simply uploaded to dropbox, google drive etc.

Here's how it works:

It's social in the same way URLs are social.
