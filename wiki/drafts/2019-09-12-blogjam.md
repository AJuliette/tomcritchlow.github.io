title: Networked Communities 4 - Press Space to Enter.
subtitle: Musings on digital gathering spaces
---

To recap briefly some of the notes so far in this blogchain -

- We want to weave a public web but why don't we blog more? Brendan explores barriers.
- We introduce the idea of "sidewalk spaces" that create communities
- Brendan explores positive gatekeeping and ways to intentionally keep communities small by limited members

But, what if there's another way to keep a community small - not by limited members but by limiting the time window?

Cody recently explored the idea of "pop-up social networks" in his great piece [conductor social networks](https://medium.com/@CodyBrown/conductor-social-networks-8ede9f13f24d):

> There is a human scale feeling to the space that is so completely lost when I sign in to Twitter each morning. Itâ€™s like the difference between entering a concert hall and waking up in The Tower of Babel.

## Real-time Gathering Spaces

Sidewalk life relies on places where you can have unplanned interactions - coffee shops, hardware stores, corner stores, stoops, block parties etc.

But when we think about the web (especially the blog-y bit of it) it's easy to get caught up in the archive and the longevity of it all. Instead, it's the real time interactions we crave.

It's a mistake to think of a twitter thread as a blog post equivalent.

While some twitter threads become immortalized and evergreen mostly the distinction between a twitter thread and a blog post is that it's real-time in the feed.

This is an important distinction.

## Algorithms vs Sidewalks

I think this might be one reason why algorithmic feeds betray us - they destroy the notion that we're in the feed **together** and instead make us together alone.

Instead from the perspective of the platforms ("seeing like a platform") the "right" behavior is to create private group chat threads (e.g. whatsapp groups). But these are private, not semi-public like sidewalk spaces need to be.

Of course this idea isn't new:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">so many intense and lively twitter debates should just be held in an ephemeral read-only discord channel<br><br>a lot of real-time nuance, dialogue, and clarification are lost in these monster threads</p>&mdash; quadrillion dollar coach (@ryandawidjan) <a href="https://twitter.com/ryandawidjan/status/1071177930175406080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 7, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

There is a large graveyard of websites, apps, startups and ideas that have tried to crack this digital sidewalk / digital campfire space. Perhaps they're forever doomed to be built, abandoned and reinvented over and over again. Maybe that's ok.

After all - coffee shops and local sidewalk spaces shift and change all the time.
