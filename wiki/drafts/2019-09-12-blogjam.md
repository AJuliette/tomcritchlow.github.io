title: Networked Communities 4 - Press Space to Enter.
subtitle: Musings on digital gathering spaces
---

To recap briefly some of the notes so far in this blogchain -

- We want to weave a public web but why don't we blog more? Brendan explores barriers.
- We introduce the idea of "sidewalk spaces" that create communities
- Brendan explores positive gatekeeping and ways to intentionally keep communities small by limited members

But, what if there's another way to keep a community small - not by limited members but by limiting the time window?

Cody recently explored the idea of "pop-up social networks" in his great piece [conductor social networks](https://medium.com/@CodyBrown/conductor-social-networks-8ede9f13f24d):

> There is a human scale feeling to the space that is so completely lost when I sign in to Twitter each morning. Itâ€™s like the difference between entering a concert hall and waking up in The Tower of Babel.

## Real-time Gathering Spaces

Sidewalk life relies on places where you can have unplanned interactions - coffee shops, hardware stores, corner stores, stoops, block parties etc.

But when we think about the web (especially the blog-y bit of it) it's easy to get caught up in the archive and the longevity of it all. Instead, it's the real time interactions we crave.

It's a mistake to think of a twitter thread as a blog post equivalent.

While some twitter threads become immortalized and evergreen mostly the distinction between a twitter thread and a blog post is that it's real-time in the feed.

This is an important distinction.

## Algorithms vs Sidewalks

I think this might be one reason why algorithmic feeds betray us - they destroy the notion that we're in the feed **together** and instead make us together alone.

Instead from the perspective of the platforms ("seeing like a platform") the "right" behavior is to create private group chat threads (e.g. whatsapp groups). But these are private, not semi-public like sidewalk spaces need to be.

Of course this idea isn't new:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">so many intense and lively twitter debates should just be held in an ephemeral read-only discord channel<br><br>a lot of real-time nuance, dialogue, and clarification are lost in these monster threads</p>&mdash; quadrillion dollar coach (@ryandawidjan) <a href="https://twitter.com/ryandawidjan/status/1071177930175406080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 7, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

There is a large graveyard of websites, apps, startups and ideas that have tried to crack this digital sidewalk / digital campfire space. Perhaps they're forever doomed to be built, abandoned and reinvented over and over again. Maybe that's ok.

After all - coffee shops and local sidewalk spaces shift and change all the time.

So... join me for a blogjam. Schedule it.



## Barriers to Entry

That said - maybe there's light at the end of the tunnel. As software gets cheaper and "easier" what if we can build our own little sidewalk spaces? Socket.io makes this trivially easy. There's an [example on Glitch that shows how to build a real-time chat room using socket.io](https://glitch.com/~socketio-chat).

I forked that to make my own chatroom. If you're reading this post "in real time" I'll be hanging out here - come say hi:
