Ads take a psychographic toll on us. They confuse, interrupt and aggravate us.

The social contract for advertising has shifted dramatically - in a short span of a few years the default mental model of "ads are defined by channel" has been inverted to the default being "ads are defined by user targeting independent of platform".

Programmatic advertising, Cambridge Analytica and the lived experience of Instagram reveal to noraml end users the underlying machinery at work. You would have to be blind not to spot the connection between clicking on a watch ad and then seeing a million watch ads ([as I document in my post blood in the feed](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/06/06/blood-in-the-feed/))

## Obfuscated Meaning

When you see a digital ad - it's fair to ask "why was I specifically shown this ad?" or, to take it one step further: "which parts of this ad were made specifically for me?"

But there's a lot of mysticism left, and most platforms provide almost zero visibility into the underlying mechanisms at work.

When I see a specific ad - for example this one:

It's obvious and clear why I'm seeing it. I visited bonobos.com recently.

But what about something like this:

![](/images/margsad.png)

Am I seeing this because:

- I visited the website of Cazadores tequila? (I haven't)
- I have clicked an ad for tacos or tequila (possible, but I don't recall doing so)
- I've been identified as a spirits drinker (likely)
- I'm a recovering alcoholic (not true)
- I've been algorithmicaly targeted as pre-alcoholic (how would we know?)

My point is - even as a sophisticated digital media professional who knows more than most I don't know exactly why this ad is being shown to me. Or, who else it's being shown to.

Yes, some platforms let you ask "why am I seeing this ad" providing a pretense of transparency but the results are laughably meaningless:

## The Programmatic Mirror

So as the expected behaviour trends towards being rational, with a logic provided for why I'm seeing watch ads (I clicked a watch website!) increasingly we can look at the ads shown us as a mirror to our own wants and needs.

But the machinery underlying programmatic ads is still naieve, broken in and inefficient in many ways.

And how does that make us feel? What do they know on us? Am I pregnant? Am I an alcoholic? 

Algorithms are predatory. They are hunt for conditions. One click on a pins website and you're hunted by the algorithms, not just for that one website but all pins websites. There's blood in the feed. The algorithms taste it and the hunt is on.

Every ad is a pre-crime.

The social contract has shifted from assuming negligence to assuming personalization. What does that do to our psyche?
