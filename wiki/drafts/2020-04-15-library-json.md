There's been a lot of discussion around a "better" GoodReads and at some point almost every side-project-slinger has tried their hand at building a "books website". Myself included.

Back in 2010 I built a site called [7books](https://tomcritchlow.com/projects/7books/) - the tagline was playlists for bookworms and it looked like this:

There is a large graveyard of these books sites.

But there are (at least) three fundamental problems with building a GoodReads competitor:

### 1. Amazon owns the only good book index

As far as I know there is no good reliable book index that's open. Books come in so many different formats, re-issues, versions, languages and publishers that maintaining a canonical reference for a specific book is very tough.

### 2. A books website is a cultural black hole

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Same is true of music social networks. Cultural black holes. Seductive and imaginary ideas about social networks that just don&#39;t work.</p>&mdash; Tom Critchlow (@tomcritchlow) <a href="https://twitter.com/tomcritchlow/status/1164386179187433472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 22, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

It's one of those alluring ideas that just does. not. work.

### 3. The only path to monetization is Amazon

Closely related to point #1 - the only (effective) way to monetize a books website is through Amazon. Any books site of meaningful size would get cut from the Amazon affiliate program in a heartbeat as it would compete directly with both Amazon and GoodReads.

But...

## Web of Books

On closer examination I realized that I'm not really interested in building a "startup" or a "business" around this - what I really want is 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Would love to see a &quot;web of books&quot; emerge from the indie web rather than via fixing goodreads</p>&mdash; Tom Critchlow (@tomcritchlow) <a href="https://twitter.com/tomcritchlow/status/1170340177702785024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 7, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
