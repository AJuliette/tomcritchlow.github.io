Rem Koolhaas provided context for modern space - for modern living - in his 2002 essay Junkspace. In the essay Rem provides a glimpse of the flattening, commercializing and colonizing of space:

>"Junkspace is post-existential; it makes you uncertain where you are, obscures where you go, undoes where you were."

The essay uses the airport as the first spaces to become Junkspace. Out of time and out of place they become everywhere and nowhere.

But out experience of space has been transformed once again - because every space now is a dual-space. The space we inhabit physically and the corresponding digital space that we consume. Wherever we are. Everywhere and nowhere.

Our physical space has been subsumed by the digital - waiting in airports the screens on the walls are bigger and louder than ever - but they fade away against the screens in our hands. Personal. Intimate. Glowing.

In this way - junkspace has been digitized and replaced by the screens in our hands. From Junkspace to Junkfeeds.

As we shift into the 22nd century we will pretend "things are getting better". The architecture and space of Junkspace will get better - fewer screens, tastefully designed. Because junkspace is no longer junkspace it's just space. Background space. The star of the show is Junkfeeds.

Pop-up instagram-space is trying so hard but that too will fade away. Physical space is done. It's been colonized and replaced by Junkfeeds. An infinite colorful horror-scape that's always changing, new, personalized and in your hand, bag, pocket. Never more than 60cm from your eyes at any time of day or night.

Feeds weren't always bad. In the early internet feeds were a good thing - RSS as artisinal or "free" feeds were hailed as "the answer".

But digital space became colonized, commercialized and flattened. The FANGs are sunk deep in us now. Facebook is the posterchild of destruction.

These RSS-feeds were radical and owned by no one. Until they were killed and replaced by centralized, commercialized feeds. Facebook gave the illusion of "human-powered-technology". See what your friends are up to.

This digital space spread like a virus - every space became Facebook's. Every waking minute is spent doing something or doing Facebook. The toilet? Facebook's. The airport? Definitely Facebook's. The underneath, between the legs of the conference room? Facebook's.

To begin with these feeds were populated by humans - humans sharing real content with other humans. But of course there is a better way. So human shared posts become 

Unfolding content. Origami-spam. Unasked for. Irrelevant. Inpersonal.

Of flesh and glass
The darkness of brightly lit screens.



The algorithm does not recommend - it reflects. It's a machine for turning our own biases against us. Literally programmed it is a recipe for turning depravation into clicks.




Rem Koolhaas laid out the foundations of modern space in his essay Junkspace. But as we tipple over into the eve of 2020 it's time to acknowledge that Junkspace has been colonized by Junkfeeds. As our experience of space increasingly overlaps with digital space our physical environments are prone to viruses and hacking. And junkfeeds have fully and successfully hacked our physical environment.

The human neck has been slumped by junkfeeds. In every space. At every point in time.

Junkfeeds started as an authentic human space of sharing - here are things to be interested in, excited about, important things, small things. This notion was quickly gutted. Facebook removed organic audiences from you unless you pay, Facebook and Twitter revealed the algorithmic timeline.

But the feeds accelerated and became industrialized two things happened.

Below the surface of junkfeeds algorithms shape the content to normalize and sanitize it. Like the underbelly of workers at the hotel you stay at. Invisible infrastructure to ensure minimum viable sanitation. Removing any content that is an outlier.

And Google eventually, bigger than twitter, has removed humans entirely (and next perhaps is going to be the human-written content underneath)

Junkfeeds are slot machines. Gambling with our attention and emotional response. We used to "play" the slots by dragging to refresh, but the feeds now infinite and real time no longer require refreshing. Now, we "play" by interacting with the feed. Hearting, thumbsing, commenting, (and not very often) clicking. But every click in the junkfeed spawns more feed. A fractal reward for playing the junkfeed.

The subtle soothing reassuring voice of Instagram saying "you're all caught up" sits in stark contrast to the reality of a 4-dimensional infinity of infinite feeds within the app. The "feed", stories, activity feed, "search". Search function is the unregulated feed of our basest emotions sidestepping any notion of people you know and mmoving straight to third base with sex, abs, comedy, guns, politics, travel. It's a funhouse mirror of our own desires reflected back to us in an infinite feed.


I'm optimistic for the future though - teens, raised as junkfeed-native, not web-native but algorithm-native are increasingly creating protection for themselves. They do not see identity:user as 1:1 rather many:many. They create throw-away accounts and trash existing accounts with abandon. They have learned to turn themselves into **junkusers** to shield themselves from the junkfeeds.




Junkfeeds colonise junkspace

Sections:

User generated to computer generated

Infinite feeds

Spawning-fractal feeds (click on a link and generate more)

Political feeds - dismembering politics

Disenfranchising - youthfeeds, from junkfood to junkfeeds

Everywhere is junkspace now. Everytime is junkfeeds. Junktime.


Americans spend quiet time in their car. Staring at their phone. At their junkfeeds.

An excellent version of the essay Junkspace appears here rendered in a beautiful digtial version by Caavia here: https://www.cavvia.net/junkspace/ and is a perfect digital companion to this essay.


Junkfeeds. (posted on junkfeeds.com ?)

Thesis: industrialized and algorithmic feeds have sucked the "feed" dry. But there is value in subscribing to flows if we can learn to put the junkfeeds in their place and build smaller personal flows. We'll do that via 


The algorithmic feed is designed (for whom? by whom?) to deliver us "better" content.

Practical tips:

Remove algorithmic timelines
Nurture small feeds


Everywhere is junkspace now. Everytime is junkfeeds. Junktime.

Junkfeeds - click a link and it spawns a fractal of new variations for you. For YOU.

"Junkspace is post-existential; it makes you uncertain where you are, obscures where you go, undoes where you were."

"Junkspace is often described as a space of flows, but that is a misnomer; flows depend on disciplined movement, bodies that cohere. Junkspace is a web without spider; although it is an architecture of the masses, each trajectory is strictly unique."

"search" function within FB/Twitter has become an infinite feed of pre-searches. Pre-crimes. Filled with the basest desires.

Same for youtube.

"Junkspace pretends to unite, but it actually splinters. It creates communities not of shared interest or free association, but of identical statistics and unavoidable demographics, an oportunistic weave of vested interests. Each man, woman and child is individually targeted, tracked, split off from the rest.. Fragments come together at 'security' only, where a grid of video screens disappointingly reassembles individual frames into a banalized, utilitarian cubism that reveals junkspace's overall coherence to the dispassionate glare of barely trained guards: videoethnography in its brute form. "

"The 21st century will bring 'intelligent' Junkspace: on a big digital 'dashboard': sales, CNNNYSENASDAQC-SPAN, anything that goes up or down, from good to bad, presented in real time like the automotive theory course that complements driving lessons..."

"Conceptually, each monitor, each TV screen is a substitute for a window; real life is inside, cyberspace has become the great outdoors..."
