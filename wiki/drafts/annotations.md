I love Hypothesis! It feels robust but their UI leaves a little to be desired. Especially on mobile.

Compare:

Google Docs
Genius
Hypothesis
Medium?

desktop/mobile UI flows.

What is the future of annotations?

What if twitter built an annotation tool - something to allow you to grab a quote from any web-page and tweet it (with a link back to the in-line document).
