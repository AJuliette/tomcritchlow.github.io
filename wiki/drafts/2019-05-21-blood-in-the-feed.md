I very rarely click ads. I mean, people say that but - it's true:

But machine learning is getting good (or lucky) and they served me this ad for a neon green watch. And I clicked.


Of course, algorithms are predatory - they are constantly hunting

So the next 24 hours sent me a phone raft of watch ads:

There's blood in the feed and the algorithms can smell it.

The opposite of blood in the feed is algorithmic whiplash - a sense of dislocation that comes from the algorithm trying to guess whether you're interested in RBA rates or a UFC fight. This sense of unreal disbelief - how can you get things so wrong?
