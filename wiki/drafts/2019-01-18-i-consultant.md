The thing no one tells you when you set out on your own is that you take on the task of managing your own labels. Inventing terms to describe who you are and what you do. 

This can feel like *"soft"* work - somehow less important than the *"real"* work of finding clients, setting up an LLC, etc. But the truth is that the labels you use to describe yourself are crucial to your self-identity in the world of independent work.

And, counter-intuitively, the label you need is not one that works for others (clients, friends etc) - it's a label that works for you. The real audience is the person looking back at you in the mirror. A label you can feel comfortable and confident with.

*Do I justify this label?*

*Am I really good enough to be X?*

*Who am I to charge clients for Y?*

*What am I doing?*

*What do I want to be?*

## Tend to your labels as you grow

When you’re fully employed, we get a steady paycheck but we also get a **stable, recognized label**. You say “I'm a product manager at IBM" (for example). When you step out on your own you suddenly remove the construct that provides this plug-and-play identity and are left to make one up on your own.

When you first leap into the unknown it's often easy to describe who you are - you're defined by what you just left.

"I just quit Google to head out on my own."

“Ex-McKinsey Partner.”

“Work & Co Alumni.”

This framing is easy and safe - and it's totally ok to lean on this. While you will feel the urge to create new labels and framing for yourself it's ok for this process to take some time and in the interim you can just tell your story.

As the days turn into weeks and months though, new language will emerge.

When I headed out on my own into the world of independent work I used the word “consulting”{% include tufte-sn.html id="consultant" content="This is largely because I used the term ‘consulting’ when I was doing client work at the agency Distilled pre-Google." %} to describe the kind of client work I was doing. But it didn't feel right to call myself a "consultant" yet.

If you’ve done client work before, it might feel instinctive to use whatever word you used then.  But now that you’re out on your own, and you’ll likely wrestle with the kind of language you feel is “true” or “earned”:

*Self-employed*? Sure. (though that implies that I'm paying the bills?)

*Freelancer*? Probably. (though that implies a short term version of full-time work?)

As you head into the unknown of independent work you should worry less about this label - **no one will care about is as much as you do** - and it’s less an absolute definition of who you are and more a process of growing into the person you want to be.

## The angst of labels

But still, labels cause angst. You will likely wrestle with them and lose sleep over them. I know I did (and still do on occasion!).

The angst here comes in three ways:

Firstly, you imagine that this label matters **externally**. Positioning is often discussed in the context of "market positioning" or "positioning statement" - something that helps potential clients find and engage with you. That's true, to a degree. But for many independents the label is less important externally than it is internally. Clients tend to look for evidence, content, associations and perspective that aligns with theirs. They tend to be indifferent to the specifics of the label you use (e.g. a consultant or a freelancer).

Secondly, you imagine that you have to **earn** your label. That somehow others have the power to *grant* you use of a label. No one has that power, but a lot is riding on the shared belief that institutions can and do control this power. Part of being untethered and free-floating independent is existing outside of the gatekeeper infrastructure. Toby says it better than me:

Thirdly, you have to reconcile your **personal and professional identities**.

## Identity is a multi-faceted construct

It took me about two years of independent work before I started to evolve multiple labels for myself. Living up to one label seemed hard enough for a long time.

But the truth is that once we stop thinking of identity as something someone else grants to us - and we start thinking of it as a personal form of empowerment - then we can start to see that multiple identities, and hence labels, are useful and more genuine than a forced single label.

## Psychic Armor for the Arena of Capitalism

See: https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/on-what-it-takes-to-sustain-a-creative-life-financially/

> At that point, I was charging $25-30 an hour and loved what I was doing, but soon realized that in my work, I’d often create systems that erased the job I was initially hired to do. **That’s when I realized I could start calling myself a consultant. Owning the title “consultant” enabled a psychological shift in the way I thought about the work I was doing. This shift led me to increase my rate again**, and eventually to articulate the skills I could offer new clients in the form of a program, complete with a business name, website, and set of rates. Before I articulated this “business offering” in a clear program, my annual revenue was around $40k. After making it clear exactly what I could offer potential clients, and by shifting my offerings based on what I saw clients finding most useful, my revenue jumped to $60k, then $85k, and last year (2018) it was $110k. (Remember, these numbers are revenue, not net profit.)

Identity formation and label creation is not just aspirational and emotional - it can be functional too.

Probably the most important role that identity plays for an independent is in crafting not a personal identity but a deliberately professional identity. Again, not as positioning for the market - but as emotional protection from the traumas of capitalism.

The best advice you can get when you're starting out as an independent is to raise your rates. Charge more. Value your worth higher.

This is true and good advice, and you’ll hear it again and again, not because people get it wrong as much as.... it's hard!

Having the self-confidence and authority to command premium rates is intrinsically linked to a sense of self-worth and identity. And by extension - **any doubt or wavering of self-confidence causes psychic trauma / cognitive dissonance when you attempt to attach dollars to your personal identity**.

One has a vague sense of what rate feels too low, but almost anything above that seems too high.

So this idea of creating a professional identity via your independent work is important as psychic armor as you step into the arena of capitalism. You need a construct to do the charging *for you*.

For me personally I think not in terms of Tom Critchlow sending you this invoice, but in terms of *my consulting business* sending you this invoice{% include tufte-sn.html id="yesand" content="I wrestled with a professional identity a while back in this post <a href='https://tomcritchlow.com/2016/08/01/brand/'>Why I've decided not to launch a brand for my consulting work</a>. While I decided not to create a website and ‘branding’ for this agency called Yes, and… I did end up forming an LLC and use that construct on all my invoices." %}.

How do you develop a capitalist construct? For me, it’s as simple as leaning on the word “consultant”. To me, it implies authority and an associated price tag. For others, creating a “studio” branding might be the construct needed to charge well.

The worst thing to do is to let your personal identity be the thing that does the billing (regardless of whether it comes from “your name LLC” or not, don’t let your **personal identity** be the construct you use){% include tufte-sn.html id="timemoney" content="Interestingly, <a href='https://www.thecut.com/2019/02/why-freelancing-creates-anxiety-about-money.html'>studies have shown</a> that those who bill hourly are more likely to see time and money as the same and take less pleasure in leisure activity. I think a professional identity and construct can help alleviate this problem slightly. Also a good reminder to not charge hourly! Day rates are better." %}.

<span class="contributor">TS: A crucial distinction that needs to be made by the time we get to the “psychic armor” section is that there are indeed multiple identities—we have an identity, a certain way of being, at work, at home, with our kids, with our friends… etc. And within that we have different permutations, micro-identities if you will, for sales, for lengthy engagements, for clients we don’t like… Especially in this section we are talking about creating the “clients + sales” construct, and how to step into that one particular persona, so it needs to be clear by now that these different roles exist. We shouldn’t be encouraging people to merge their work and other identities more than is natural for them. Maybe the section below needs to come first and be expanded? Actually, it might come earlier than that, perhaps in the introduction even…..</span>

## The Angst of Reconciling Professional & Personal Identities

There’s another kind of angst to watch out for. As we develop a multi-faceted set of identities and labels for using in different situations we have to understand that some people - often by design! - will only see some small slice of your identity.

Especially when it comes to reconciling your personal and professional identities, this can cause some angst as people mis-interpret or under-estimate the broad spectrum of who you are and instead mistake the label for the identity, the map for the terrority.

This has happened to me recently{% include tufte-sn.html id="fouryears" content="For those following the timeline weaving through this piece this is 4+ years into my independent work at this point!" %} - twice in the past month I've received instances of twitter hate from folks taking issue with the label of 'consultant'.

I… honestly I’m not sure exactly how to deal with this yet. On the one hand I can brush it off since they’re mistaking my personal identity for my professional identity{% include tufte-sn.html id="personalidentity" content="<em>’I’m more than a consultant - what about my love for writing, my poker career, my art business, etc, etc’</em> - these are the thoughts that run through my head as I get defensive when someone attacks my professional identity" %}. But on the other hand it’s unsettling to be on the receiving end of an insult.

Both times the insults came from those in the graphic design community jumping on, and deriding, the terms strategy/consulting. Mostly this feels fine since it feels like a natural extension of the “graphic design as being authentic” vs “strategy/consulting being vaporware” debate that is bigger than me (and is also a stupid argument imho).

So I suppose I don’t have good advice here except to tread lightly, move with grace and watch out for any time the gap between your perceived professional identity strays too far from your actual personal identity (and identities).

## “The Question” & the identity crisis

"The Question". Inevitably in many consulting projects (especially those where you're embedding inside an organization either physically or digitally) there will come a time when they ask you to give up the independent lifestyle and join full time.

I’ve been faced with this question no fewer than 5 times over the course of my time as an independent, and **every single time** it throws me on an emotional rollercoaster.

*How is independent work really going?*

*They like me!*

*Will I really be able to keep getting work if I turn this down? Where will my next client come from?*

*Wow - I’d be able to call myself [insert desirable full-time label here]*

*What am I doing with my life anyway?*

All of these questions and a million more come to mind when a client offers you a full time role. The reason this question is able to throw you for a loop is because it challenges your self-made identity (or identities). It directly confronts and questions your ability to stand behind the labels you’ve chosen - by placing them in contrast to the “authoritative” and “well-understood” and “recognizable” label that they’re offering you.

I remember a few years ago when my consulting work slowed down slightly and I took a job interview via a friend. I ended up with a job offer to become Creative Director{% include tufte-sn.html id="cd" content="Notice how I’m still using the label here! I’m using the story and their perceived authority to help position myself as part Creative Director. This emotional journey never ends…." %} at a digital innovation studio. Despite  the fact that the salary they offered me was half what I earned that year, I almost took the job! I think it would have been a huge mistake but wow do those identity questions make you lose some sleep.

## Poetry over Power

Many times titles and labels are a show of power. Some display of strength over others. **I have this label** is the same as saying **I have this power**.

I’d encourage you to think of poetry instead of power. No one has claims on anyone else and part of the freedom of being independent is breaking free from some of those traditional power structures.

Use language and labels as a texture to provide as much psychological safety and identity as you need. If you feel less secure - choose labels that are well-understood. If you need to feel like an outsider - choose labels that are unique and unusual. If you want to be weird, be weird. You can hold a poetry over your own identity this way. Bewitching yourself is completely allowed.

From the book *Finite & Infinite Games*:

> “Therefore, poets do not 'fit' into society, not because a place is denied them but because they do not take their 'places' seriously. They openly see its roles as theatrical, its styles as poses, its clothing costumes, its rules conventional, its crises arranged, its conflicts performed and its metaphysics ideological.”

<span class="contributor">TS: Poets also play with language, they eviscerate it, they juxtapose and damage it and graft new branches of meaning onto it with their words.</span>

So play with labels, understand their power not over others but over ourselves. Understand their ability to provide shelter in the capitalist storm and then, eventually, discard them entirely and embrace the poetry of life.
