title: Help me write my book by annotating the outline
subtitle: Experiments in cultivating annotations on this site
layout: blog

Hey, let's try something new today. Two things I want to do:

Firstly - I've got [Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/) annotations installed by default on my blog so everytime you highlight some text you get the ability to leave an annotation. Think of it like in-line comments just like Google Docs. But few people know how to use it or have an account - so the best way to get people comfortable with this is just to actively encourage it{% include tufte-sn.html id="community" content="Directly cultivating community is a great thing to kickstart engagement - I did this a long time ago when I first installed disqus and it was fun! See that post here: <a href='https://tomcritchlow.com/2016/08/25/community/'>Intentional Communities</a>" %}! Please try it out and let me know how you feel!

Secondly - I'm in the middle of writing a book. And I want to use the excuse of cultivating community and getting people familiar with Hypothesis to help me out by annotating the book outline below.

I'd love to get your comments, feedback, ideas and suggestions for where the outline and chapters fall short, where you enjoyed what you read so far and where you want to see more. (Of course, if you don't want to use Hypothesis then there's the usual Disqus at the bottom of the post).

## The Book - Working title: The Strategic Independent



Deliberate community.

Write the outline and ask for annotations.
