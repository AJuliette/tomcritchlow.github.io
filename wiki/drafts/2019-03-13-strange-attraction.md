The Lorenz Attractor is a chaotic system - a strange attractor. It’s an elegant and beautiful mathematical object that looks a bit like this:

Chaotic systems are often referenced in popular culture via the well-known butterfly effect: *“Does the flap of a butterfly’s wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas?”*.

The general principle with chaotic systems is that no matter how carefully you try and control the inputs, the outputs will always surprise you.

This… **sounds a lot like the lead flow for my consulting business!**

After doing this for 4 years it’s still a surprise when and where leads come through - almost every time it’s *“why did this happen? Why now?”*.

But it doesn’t mean the whole thing is random! There’s a distinction between random systems and chaotic systems. If you look at the Lorenz Attractor you can tell it’s not random - there’s a system at work - the key with chaotic systems is that you can’t control for individual outputs, but you can shape the system at large.

In this post I’m going to break down my personal system and philosophy for generating leads for my consulting practice - embracing the chaos of generating warm leads from real humans. It all boils down to controlling for system-level outputs not individual outcomes by focusing on the following:

- Focus on networks over networking
- Articulate your work
- Publish to be present

I’ll explain, but first:

## A quick primer on my work

It’s worth explaining the kind of work I do, with some important caveats. I do strategic consulting work as an independent. Often I’m embedded within a client’s organization and often for long periods of time (for example - think two days a week in the office for 18 months working across a variety of projects{% include tufte-sn.html id="four" content="<img src='https://tomcritchlow.com/images/4yearsrevenue.png' /> For a visual representation of my work see my post <a href='https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/10/24/four-years/'>four years on the road</a>." %}).

This means that - for me - I’m primarily concerned with **warm leads** for long term **strategic work**.

It’s important for **leads to be warm** - because it’s hard to convince someone to spend $20k / month on a consulting contract without them already thinking they might spend money on consulting (and having some kind of budget earmarked!)

It’s important for **leads to be primed for long term strategic work** - because you want large enough problems that the senior leadership of the business is talking to you. It’s hard (though not impossible) to “escalate” a conversation from a more junior employee up to their boss.

This means that for me - I’m definitely optimizing for quality over quantity. 8 leads a year can keep me full up. And I think for many independents this should be the case - optimizing for quantity will create a very different environment.

The varieties of styles and approaches to independent work will surprise you so I won’t claim to say this is the only way to do things but it works for me so maybe you’ll learn something to add to your own approach.

## All my friends are strange attractors

The Lorenz System is classified as a strange attractor - as mentioned above it’s a chaotic system - which means that no matter how closely you observe the initial conditions you will always be surprised by the output.

Aside from being beautiful (and the loops looking the wings of a butterfly if you squint!) I find this visualization oddly satisfying and descriptive of two people’s lives. Their orbits entwined - strangely.

I imagine every relationship as some kind of Lorenz strange loop - with us at times orbiting closely and at times drifting apart. This notion of friendship with vast unknowable orbits.

But people - humans - contacts - friends - is where I get all of my business from. All of the leads for my consulting business come from a small number of people. In fact, running the numbers 60% of my all-time consulting revenue can be traced to just four people:

|  Person | % of all-time revenue  |
|---|---|
| A  | 9.71%  |
| B  | 24.23%  |
| C  | 21.96%  |
| D  | 4.48%  |

What does this feel like in practice?
