The Lorenz Attractor is a chaotic system - a strange attractor. It’s an elegant and beautiful mathematical object that looks a bit like this:

Chaotic systems are often referenced in popular culture via the well-known butterfly effect: *“Does the flap of a butterfly’s wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas?”*.

The general principle with chaotic systems is that no matter how carefully you try and control the inputs, the outputs will always surprise you.

This… **sounds a lot like the lead flow for my consulting business!**

After doing this for 4 years it’s still a surprise when and where leads come through - almost every time it’s *“why did this happen? Why now?”*.

But it doesn’t mean the whole thing is random! There’s a distinction between random systems and chaotic systems. If you look at the Lorenz Attractor you can tell it’s not random - there’s a system at work - the key with chaotic systems is that you can’t control for individual outputs, but you can shape the system at large.

In this post I’m going to break down my personal system and philosophy for generating leads for my consulting practice - embracing the chaos of generating warm leads from real humans. It all boils down to controlling for system-level outputs not individual outcomes by focusing on the following:

- Focus on networks over networking
- Articulate your work
- Publish to be present

I’ll explain, but first:

## A quick primer on my work

It’s worth explaining the kind of work I do, with some important caveats. I do strategic consulting work as an independent. Often I’m embedded within a client’s organization and often for long periods of time (for example - think two days a week in the office for 18 months working across a variety of projects{% include tufte-sn.html id="four" content="<img src='https://tomcritchlow.com/images/4yearsrevenue.png' /> For a visual representation of my work see my post <a href='https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/10/24/four-years/'>four years on the road</a>." %}).

This means that - for me - I’m primarily concerned with **warm leads** for long term **strategic work**.

It’s important for **leads to be warm** - because it’s hard to convince someone to spend $20k / month on a consulting contract without them already thinking they might spend money on consulting (and having some kind of budget earmarked!)

It’s important for **leads to be primed for long term strategic work** - because you want large enough problems that the senior leadership of the business is talking to you. It’s hard (though not impossible) to “escalate” a conversation from a more junior employee up to their boss.

This means that for me - I’m definitely optimizing for quality over quantity. 8 leads a year can keep me full up. And I think for many independents this should be the case - optimizing for quantity will create a very different environment.

The varieties of styles and approaches to independent work will surprise you so I won’t claim to say this is the only way to do things but it works for me so maybe you’ll learn something to add to your own approach.

## All my friends are strange attractors

The Lorenz System is classified as a strange attractor - as mentioned above it’s a chaotic system - which means that no matter how closely you observe the initial conditions you will always be surprised by the output.

Aside from being beautiful (and the loops looking the wings of a butterfly if you squint!) I find this visualization oddly satisfying and descriptive of two people’s lives. Their orbits entwined - strangely.

I imagine every relationship as some kind of Lorenz strange loop - with us at times orbiting closely and at times drifting apart. This notion of friendship with vast unknowable orbits.

But people - humans - contacts - friends - is where I get all of my business from. All of the leads for my consulting business come from a small number of people. In fact, running the numbers 60% of my all-time consulting revenue can be traced to just four people:

What does this feel like in practice?

## A butterfly flutters

Somewhere in London in 2010(?) I met two gentlemen at a networking dinner. If I’m honest I don’t recall this in any way shape or form. But someone I worked with in London around the same time who is now a close friend popped into my inbox in 2016 to make a strange attraction intro…

This lead turned into one of the biggest single sources of consulting revenue since I’ve been out on my own.

Another one:

This turned into a super-useful project for me that snowballed into the last year working in media. Funny how those things go.

Sometimes though it’s people you don’t know very well. This is someone who I interviewed for a senior role at a previous job - who then turned the tables and put me forward for a consulting gig:

Ok - so... Humans power this whole warm-leads business.

But of all the humans I know - why these ones? Is it random? How can we motivate people to send us work? There’s two things you can do - build a network and talk to them.

## Ways to build a network of strange attractors

It’s obvious - but often overlooked - that to build a flow of warm referrals you need to have a network of folks who know you, and know what projects you’re a good fit for. So how do you build a larger network? Some approaches:

### Public Groups

My friend [Carly Ayres](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p4v190oEA6_vSGAgIGA2HYUlCRrr1PbLNla6Z2f993w/edit) (who just sunsetted her studio - RIP Hawraf) hosts a meetup series called [100s under 100](https://www.fastcompany.com/90161136/inside-the-invite-only-slack-channel-for-designers). It’s a friends of friends kind of thing but open to a large group (these meetups range from a small group to 100s).

My friend [Mark Pollard](https://www.markpollard.net/) runs [Sweathead](https://www.facebook.com/groups/sweathead/) a public FB group for strategists. He’s a community-building natural and he actively cultivates community, engagement and audience - for example he has a [Sweathead podcast](https://www.markpollard.net/sweathead-podcast/) that interviews many people from the community itself.

These events are a great platform to build awareness and large groups of loose networks as well as gain authority by being the public figure-head of a large group.

### Private Groups

I know a variety of private invite-only groups - most of these happen on Slack these days. One in particular that is especially high signal-to-noise is the [Sunday Dinners slack group](http://www.sundaydinner.com/slack/). This group is small, has less virtue signaling - since it's private - but can be a wonderful way to build a more intimate group of close ties. These private groups are typically <150 members. Anything above that and I think you start to lose the intimate nature and it turns into something more akin to a public group.

One advantage of these private groups is the ability to discuss work-in-progress and the more raw side of client / project challenges and success. This can help bridge a true picture of what work looks like for you which sets you up for success when cultivating warm intros.

### Small gatherings
Over the past two years I’ve been hosting invite-only dinner events. They usually run 10-15 people and, honestly, are a weird mix of my actual friends, people I know doing interesting things and people who I know will get value from the weird mix I put together. There’s no structure to these events but they form bonds and connections between many different people in my networks.

Across all three of these approaches - **the key is to be the anchor of the network**. By being the anchor you gain an order of magnitude more recognition and exposure than merely attending someone else’s event or being a member in someone else’s slack. Being the anchor of a group of 10 is better than being a member of a group of 100 (though of course they’re not mutually exclusive!).
