I've been independent 5 years today.

Exactly one year ago I posted 4 years on the road. My retained revenue had just dried up and I ended on a cliffhanger:

>So what next?

>Iâ€™m floating in this funny space - I trust the process now more than I ever have and I feel confident more work will come along. But at the same time what that work will look like is a mystery right now!

>The road ahead is open. The windows are down. The mixtape is on. So far so good. Onwards where the road will take me.

Later that afternoon I get a short note "We can do this if you still have Nov/Dec/(Jan?) free. Want to connect on the details?" - an old proposal came back to life out of the blue. 5 days later I started in their office three days a week and I've been there for a year.

Funny how things go.

Here's a TL;DR of highlights and happenings from the past year:

- Kickstarer
- Travel?
- Space
- Gone from book? to book
- Blogging
- Little Futures

Some thoughts:

## What Book Writing Means to Me

Why it's important to thread a narrative through consulting.
Perosnal value
An artefact to point to that can foster speaking

## Design Sprints

Partnering with Toby/Kevin, learning Figma.

## Little Futures

## Money Musings

Took a 5-figure holiday. Will take a 5 figure paternity leave.

These things are expensive.
