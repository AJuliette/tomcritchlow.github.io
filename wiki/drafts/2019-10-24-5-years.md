I've been independent 5 years today.

I left off last year's post with a cliffhanger:


Exactly two days after that post went live I kicked off a full 12 months of retained 3-days / week in-office consulting gig.

So it goes.

Here's a TL;DR of highlights and happenings from the past year:

- Kickstarer
- Travel?
- Space
- Gone from book? to book
- Blogging
- Little Futures

Some thoughts:

## What Book Writing Means to Me

Why it's important to thread a narrative through consulting.
Perosnal value
An artefact to point to that can foster speaking

## Money Musings

Took a 5-figure holiday.
I'll take a 6 figure paternity leave.

These things are expensive.
