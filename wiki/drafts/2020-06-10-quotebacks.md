subtitle: A chrome extension to quote the web

Networked writing (aka *blogging*) has become increasingly important as a part of my identity. It's the framework for creating lifelong friendships, finding rewarding client work and experimenting with ideas as a personal creative outlet.

So, [Toby Shorin](https://subpixel.space/) and I have created a small tool called **Quotebacks**. The ultimate goal is to encourage and activate a deeper cross-blogger discusson space. To promote diverse voices and encourage *networked writing* to flourish.

But, while that's a lofty goal the tool is small and simple. Quotebacks is three things:

1. A web-native citation standard and quoting UX pattern
2. A tiny library, ```quoteback.js```, that converts HTML ```<blockquote>``` tags into elegant interactive webcomponents
3. A browser extension to create quoteback components and store any quotes you save to publish later.

[Install Quotebacks in the chrome store here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/quotebacks-quote-the-web/makakhdegdcmmbbhepafcghpdkbemach/) or find out more at [quotebacks.net](https://quotebacks.net/).

This is what an embedded quoteback looks like:

<blockquote class="quoteback" data-title="A Text Renaissance" data-author="@ribbonfarm" cite="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance/">
The text renaissance is an actual <em>renaissance. </em>It’s a story of history-inspired renewal in a very fundamental way: exciting recent developments are due in part to a new generation of young product visionaries circling back to the early history of digital text, rediscovering old, abandoned ideas, and reimagining the bleeding edge in terms of the unexplored adjacent possible of the 80s and 90s.

## Why Quotebacks

I publish this site using Jekyll - a static site templating language. That's important 





<blockquote class="quoteback" data-title="My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?" data-author="Laurel Schwulst" cite="https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/laurel-schwulst-my-website-is-a-shifting-house-next-to-a-river-of-knowledge-what-could-yours-be/">
If a website has endless possibilities, and our identities, ideas, and dreams are created and expanded by them, then it’s instrumental that websites progress along with us. It’s especially pressing when forces continue to threaten the web and the internet at large. In an age of information overload and an increasingly commercialized web, artists of all types are the people to help. Artists can think expansively about what a website can be. Each artist should create their own space on the web, for a website is an individual act of collective ambition.

Fuck that. I’m more of an editor than a developer any day, but I’ll be damned if I’m going to cede that territory. I don’t want to pour my words into a box, the parameters of which someone else decides (and obscures). I want to make the box, too. And remake it. And, hell, break it from time to time. It’s mine to break.
