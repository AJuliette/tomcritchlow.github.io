There's a bunch of discussion right now about the peacetime CEO / wartime CEO mental model ([for example here](https://taylorpearson.me/crisis-management-plan/)).

For those not familiar the peacetime CEO / wartime CEO is a famous concept:

>In peacetime, leaders must maximize and broaden the current opportunity. As a result, peacetime leaders employ techniques to encourage broad-based creativity and contribution across a diverse set of possible objectives. In wartime, by contrast, the company typically has a single bullet in the chamber and must, at all costs, hit the target. The company’s survival in wartime depends upon strict adherence and alignment to the mission.

Unfortunately this model was never useful for indies - where you cycle through periods of "wartime" all the time.

In a regular year you might get hungry for new work 4 or 5 times (this number will likely decrease the longer you're at it and the more you build up in your cash reserves).

So if peactime/wartime isn't quite the right model - what is?

## Hunting for work

Every time your work slows down as an indie you get hungry. Even though I've been lucky enough to build up some reserves I feel the bite of negative cash flow very keenly. In short - I get hungry.

For paycheck types - hunting for work is typically a discrete event. You're either looking for a job or you're not. And those events are typically spaced out 12-24 months at a time. It's a time of crisis for paycheck types because it's all or nothing - when you're out of work your income is zero.

For indies - hunting for work is an "always on" activity. You're often working for clients but not at full capacity and a typical gig lasts months not years so you're always rolling off some client project and rolling onto another.

So this is where the peacetime/wartime analogy starts to break down. For companies and paycheck types you can more safely operate in times of peace and times of war. Indies are hired guns where hunting is the only business we know and we've learned to live peacefully while always on the hunt.

So what changes for indies is not whether you're hunting but rather **how you hunt**.

## Divergent Times / Divergent Hunting

In [my last post](https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/04/08/the-quarantined-independent/) I said this:

>Finally - if you have the cash reserves to see you through this (big if…) then you should consider going subterranean and working on projects that won’t see the light of day until next year.

But I'm beginning to think this is the wrong mindset. Imagining there is a "return" to anything next year is misguided. Reality just hard forked and there's no going back. The economy may return or a new economy may emerge but it won't ever look the same again.

Instead - independents should embrace the uncertainty and leverage the fact that the indie lifestyle is best placed to explore new frontiers. As Venkatesh said:

>Work in the free-agent mode is a divergent economic activity, an evolutionary phenomenon that explores outward from a constantly expanding frontier, and acquires more depth, richness, and variety with every passing year. I call this a diverarchy -- the historical trace of a naturally divergent, expansionary, evolutionary pattern based on variation and natural selection of relatively stable forms.

## Navigating The Future

> **The tricky thing about all of this is that skill markets are not perfectly observable. You’ll have to go hunting for trends**. I’ll probably schedule a bunch of meetings at the end of this year, assuming COVID-19 blows over. And in those meetings, I’ll be listening carefully for the organisational changes my friends are experiencing at their companies.

## Opportunity Values

This is also how I'd navigate taking a full time job right now. If it's going to meaningfully open you up to divergent opportunities
