There's two threads I've been thinking about a lot recently that I want to connect here.

Firstly - the idea of frameworks. I just wrote 5,000 words about them yesterday. Forget all the theory for a second though and imagine that there are these little condensed visual thinking machines. Useful for getting people to use the same mental model of a situation.

Secondly - the idea of presenting system work, where complexity and multiple paths lead to a branching experience that is hard to capture in a linear presentation.

## Let me paint you vignette

I just wrapped up a design sprint for a client in partnership with [Toby Shorin](https://subpixel.space/). We were designing and prototyping a set of designs, but more ambitously a **system of interactions**.

Toby worked primarily in Figma - and this was a new experience for me - but I quickly adjusted to the idea of a canvas to outline, prototype and experiment with interactions, systems and multiple branching pathways through a system.

But while putting together the final client presentation something about the little white boxes of a presentation failed to convey the interesting and playful *interactions* within the system. It all felt too static and final instead of a sketched set of ideas and interactions waiting to be evolved and iterated upon.

Eventually - as I went on a little roadshow presenting this work inside the client's organization I dropped the deck entirely and switched to "presenting" the idea through figma. It was much more powerful.

## But "design spaces" don't allow for numbers and charts do they...?

Ok, so figma feels like a new fresh presentation format for me (as a strategy consultant, not a designer) but is there any portability to different kinds of work? Non-design work?

As I wrote the post yesterday on frameworks it occurs to me that each framework can be art-directed like a design concept. The layout, format, presentaion can all impact the idea. Nothing new here.

But then - for frameworks that are more numerical or chart based aren't we back to using slide-ware? Well, maybe. Except the crucial notion of frameworks is that they're able to travel inside an organization. They need to be able to be communicated.

Then - I found the most delightful video...

I just wrote a post on frameworks. 

So where do frameworks and systems interact?



This video blew my mind and showed me the path.

Aligns really well to the work done 

But where is the availability of plotters or large format printers? Are digital projects necessarily too agile or too simple for this?

Challenge of presenting via figma or via a document.

I pride myself in working in an agile way. Laptop, phone. No wires, no second screen.

But what's lost when we transition away from paper? How might we present systems thinking on large maps?

The problem of course is chaos. If everyone starts doing this it's madness.

But there's something to aspire to?

Maps for business. Inspiration from dynamicland? Jer Thorp map projections?


Maybe, just maybe, the mantra for 2020 is going to be posters not powerpoint.
