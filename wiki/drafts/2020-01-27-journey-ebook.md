title: Building an ebook version of Journey to the End of the Night for Erin
subtitle: Technical specs, challenges and creative sparks
---

I'm so proud of Erin for completing her [kids book Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/erinprz/journey-to-the-end-of-the-night-a-childrens-book) last year. Successfully completing a Kickstarter is a wild feeling but it is also the start of the race not the end!

Erin spent much of last year buried deep in logistics - print proofing, file layout, shipping research, packaging design and so much more to bring the project to life. Then we spent a mad 72 hours shipping out the physical copies.

Ironically the ebook version of the book ended up shipping after the physical one did... (btw [the physical version of the book and art prints are available to purchase on Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/ErinprzArt) now if you missed the Kickstarter!)

I've spent much of my spare moments over the past 3-4 months working on this and honestly it's still not perfectly polished. About 70% of the way through the project I realized that 

*Reminder: I am a self-taught duct-tape coder and designer not trained or even practiced in either!*

Let's call this launch a beta shall we? See any bugs hit me up.

## Lessons Learned

https://swiperjs.com/ stuttered and stalled out with full screen images on mobile. This forced me to rebuild half way through and eventually to abandon the swipe interaction alltogether.

The "right" way to comment code

iOS is extremely web-hostile. The tools, documentation and so on for doing anything creative is 

I really should pick up swift and learn how to make native apps! I think this would have been a great test app but oof trying to learn new skills from scratch when you've got a full time job and two kiddos and family commitments.


## Stories format and digital books

I think the perfect medium NYPL stories format. Some Craigmod call out.
