title: Narrative Strategy
subtitle: Thoughts on an emerging indie consulting style
---

It's no surprise that a single narrative can shape a company's fate. Just ask WeWork.

But it's just as obvious, though perhaps less talked about, that narrative can also dominate an individuals career path, or a project's fate.

In fact one of the slippery concepts around "narrative" is that it it's not just confined to "inside the company" or "the public narrative" but that these narratives weave together and can mingle, combine and breed in new and interesting ways.

I work as an independent consultant and spend a lot of time embedded inside organizations - often co-creating strategy roadmaps with my clients.

But clients are people too - and they have narratives, narratives about who they are, narratives about how their markets function and narratives around the strategies they're creating.

And sometimes - as an indie consultant - my work crosses from "consulting" to something that looks more like coaching or advising. For example with a client I've been working with for 2 years embedded in their office, we might reach a point where the consutling engagement ends but the executive hiring me keeps me on for "a phone call a week".

And that's where things get interesting. What is this work? I'm certainly not a qualified executive coach. And during these calls I retain my usual feisty opinionated perspective on my client's business. But then again - having spent significant time embedded inside the organization I have a ton of context that a traditional advisor wouldn't understand. I can talk confidently about levels of work, teams and people and strategies with varying levels of abstraction - all the way down the to details.

What I've come to believe about this "advisory" work is that the essence of it is helping the client shape narratives. What I call: narrative strategy

## Writing, Sparring & Narrative

>Sometimes I felt like I was doing many different types work, but writing this down, I realized that there's a common denominator. They largely involved communicating some emerging reality in order to drive specific audience behaviors. 
>
>How to develop a new way of seeing? And how to communicate this to stakeholders—users, investors, readers? ​These are not just "marketing" or "brand problems." In the former cases the primary audience for this work was not the public but internal stakeholders within the client company. 
>
>This is also true of the 1-on-1 thought partnership work. Here the goal was to translate macro level thinking, or personal experience, into actionable insights for the client's audience.
>
>Themes, narratives, metaphors, abstractions. They are tools for understanding. They can be deployed internally to set a vision for the company; they can drive product vision and roadmap; they can be used in sales decks; they can even be used in product interfaces.
>
>For example, it can be powerful to develop different metaphors for explaining your business. The personal finance company I worked with is a classic SEO business that makes money by affiliate marketing. They have thousands of pages of product reviews and comparisons, and thousands more offering advice on investing, saving, homeownership, and so on. If you squint, it's possible to view this company as in the business of education. We tried designing based on this assumption instead, and suddenly interface design and product strategy fell into place. Thousands of pages could be leveraged into an app-like edutainment experience. Multiple layers of stakeholders operating on a new orientation to the market.

>I have never considered brand and product to be separable, and this is part of why.

>One challenge of our era, if not the defining challenge, is to reach a coherent, actionable understanding of what is happening in our culture. This is always what I have tried to accomplish with my writing, and increasingly this is what I find myself doing in work. Little today is clear. There are still questions to be answered on how to orient to our present situation. This is cultural strategy. There are still questions to be answered on how to forge a compelling, actionable vision of the future. This is narrative strategy.

>Speaking with friends who also do “editorial adjacent” work, I came to realize that when working with small and medium organizations most of us have a direct relationship with the CEO (or perhaps a VP), and we produce largely longer form content usually not seen as marketing. In the process of researching, thinking through, and writing, we end up bringing ideas within the company and influencing its thinking. In some cases this is even done on purpose, not just as a side benefit of writing. Many of us become a kind of “Editor-in-chief of ideas circulating in the organization.”

>What I realized is that playing an editorial role for a company and influencing multiple projects and discussions are not two separate things. It’s not “writing things” and “giving opinions because you know about stuff.” A Thought Partner is someone who, through a practice of researching, reading, learning, asking questions, and writing, helps partners in developing their ideas , knowledge, and thinking.

## Articulation is the first product

Narrative strategy is especially powerful for early stage companies and startups where a founder/exec who controls the narrative internally and externally drives outsized results.
