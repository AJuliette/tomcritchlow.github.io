Being a remote consultant is tough. I'll be honest, I'm having a hard time being as effective as I usually am.

There's three core issues I'm seeing with remote consulting:

1. Lack of context
2. Faster planning cycles
3. Lack of improv

There's two key things that remote work lacks. The first is context.

I talked in my post [the strategic independent](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/04/04/the-strategic-independent/) about importance of understanding the **overlapping contexts** that your work sits in:

<div class="portal-content-519256">So when I talk about strategic work - it’s about trying to understand the concentric circles of context at any time. For example - if you’re designing an app for a company the app might sit within a variety of business contexts:

However, in addition to the above context - that app design project might also exist within a variety of people contexts:

<div class="portal-content-519256">“Re-work the plan. Immediately. Not in a quarter. Not in a few weeks,” says Simon Khalaf, the current SVP and GM for Messaging at Twilio. (Back in 2008, he was the President and CEO of Flurry Analytics.) In other words, you shouldn’t be operating at the same tempo as you were 90 days ago, but it can be tough to go from planning quarterly to planning weekly. “We are at a time of incredible uncertainty. Changes that might have happened in a year are happening in a week. Macro shifts are happening fast, but the micro-level of what’s happening in your business — signed contracts, churn and so on — still may be slow,” says First Round’s Josh Kopelman.
