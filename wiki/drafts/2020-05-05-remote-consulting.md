Being a remote consultant is tough. I'll be honest, I'm having a hard time being as effective as usual.

There's three core issues I'm seeing with remote consulting:

1. Lack of business context
2. Lack of improv people context 
3. Faster planning cycles

I'm going to walk through them and see if we can find solutions together...

## Lack of Business Context

I talked in my post [the strategic independent](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/04/04/the-strategic-independent/) about how being strategic is fundamentally about understanding the **overlapping contexts** that your work sits in:

<div id="portal-parent-519256" class="portal-parent-519256">
<div class="portal-content-519256">So when I talk about strategic work - it’s about trying to understand the concentric circles of context at any time. For example - if you’re designing an app for a company the app might sit within a variety of business contexts:

However, in addition to the above context - that app design project might also exist within a variety of people contexts:

<div class="portal-content-519256">Missed feedback - It’s not uncommon as a consultant to be the most proficient powerpoint user in the org (or at least your portion of the org). This has benefits but it also has the unintended consequence of making everything you touch look “finished”. And finished work gets very different feedback from people than raw materials and thinking. So sometimes it’s important to un-design and un-polish your work, to invite people onto the stage to co-create the performance - this way you ensure that you get the appropriate feedback.</div>

Understanding context helps you avoid "context crashes":



**The challenge in remote work is that you get less access to adjacent contexts.**

A lot is said about the overwhelming status checkins while working remotely but, as a consultant, if anything you should be *over-indexing* on status updates.

How to do this without overwhelming yourself of course is the challenge...

## Lack of Improv & People Context

Lacking business context is one thing - but lacking people context is another. What is your point of contact working on? What are they worrying about? How are they feeling?

I wrote before about the way that consultants operate at a [serendipity deficit](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/11/18/yes-and/#the-serendipity-deficit-of-consultants--manufacturing-improv-sessions):


<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://files-lovat-six.now.sh/quote.css" type="text/css">

<div id="portal-parent-519256" class="portal-parent-519256">
<div class="portal-content-519256">A failure mode for employees is striving for work to happen in the official channels - to wait for the meeting to talk about the strategy, to wait for the email chain to pitch in. This desire to make work “official” means many employees are uncomfortable talking about their work on the way to the coffee shop or in the hallway between meetings.<br><br>But it’s exactly these free-form sessions when executives drop their guard, open up and the possibility to operate in a liminal space between contexts is possible.<br><br>And the most important thing to understand about these “spontaneous” improv sessions is that they are most useful for laying the first seed of an idea. Good ideas don’t instantly make an impact and if you want executives to pay attention you have to make sure they hear the idea several times. So drop it first in the hallway before formalizing it in a meeting.</div>

## Faster OODA Loops

<div class="portal-content-519256">“Re-work the plan. Immediately. Not in a quarter. Not in a few weeks,” says Simon Khalaf, the current SVP and GM for Messaging at Twilio. (Back in 2008, he was the President and CEO of Flurry Analytics.) In other words, you shouldn’t be operating at the same tempo as you were 90 days ago, but it can be tough to go from planning quarterly to planning weekly. “We are at a time of incredible uncertainty. Changes that might have happened in a year are happening in a week. Macro shifts are happening fast, but the micro-level of what’s happening in your business — signed contracts, churn and so on — still may be slow,” says First Round’s Josh Kopelman.</div>
