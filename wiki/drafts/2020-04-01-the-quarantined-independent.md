For the past few years I've been writing a book, serializing the posts on my blog: [The Strategic Independent](https://tomcritchlow.com/strategy/).

I've always thought of this book as trying to be a "201" level reference - useful for those who already figured out the basics.

It contains things like [how to effectively embed yourself inside client organizations](https://tomcritchlow.com/2017/07/18/the-consultants-grain/), [balancing strategy & execution](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/04/04/the-strategic-independent/) & [the theatre of work](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/11/18/yes-and/).

But we're all beginners now.

These topics feel out of touch with reality so I'm putting the book on pause and launching a new mini-series - a more urgent and hopefully more actionable series[^toby]:

[^toby]: The only blogging I've been doing has been "domestic cozy" blogging as a retreat from reality. As [Toby says](https://subpixel.space/entries/premonition/): *For three weeks, I have wondered: how much of what I’ve thought and written about on this site is even relevant now?* - but Toby concludes there is a way through - urgently and critically through reexamining our core values. Thank you Toby.

## New Blogchain: The Quarantined Independent

The series home will be here: [The Quarantined Independent](https://tomcritchlow.com/blogchains/the-quarantined-independent/). Posts will drop out serially on my blog (and there's always the [rss feed](https://tomcritchlow.com/feed.xml)).

My plan is to think through what indies can do to find & keep work, stay alive in the crisis and generally.

Here's some initial notes and ideas to kick us off.

### 1. Indies are f-ed

### 2. Mutual Aid for Indies

Now more than ever we need collaboration, cooperation and no one wants the cult of personality in these times.



### 3. Start your writing

Writing works like compound interest. Let's be clear - we're not going to blog our way out of the slump but investing in a blogging habit now will pay off next year in spades when the economy gets going again.



### 4. Show the Process

Craig Mod is doing this wonderfully. Nothing braggy or showy. Just showing up and livestreaming the work. Note how the work here is not even client work - but it shows off the range of capabilities wonderfully.

This is a totally sui generis cataclysm.</p>&mdash; Venkatesh Rao (@vgr) <a href="https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1244101836753129473?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 29, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
