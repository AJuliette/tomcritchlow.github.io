For the past few years I've been writing a book, serializing the posts on my blog: [The Strategic Independent](https://tomcritchlow.com/strategy/).

I've always thought of this book as trying to be a "201" level reference - useful for those who already figured out the basics.

It contains things like [how to effectively embed yourself inside client organizations](https://tomcritchlow.com/2017/07/18/the-consultants-grain/), [balancing strategy & execution](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/04/04/the-strategic-independent/), [the theatre of work](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/11/18/yes-and/) etc.

But we're all beginners now. And these topics seem abstract and out of touch with our reality.

So I'm putting the book on pause and launching a new mini-series - a more urgent and hopefully more actionable series[^toby]:

[^toby]: The only blogging I've been doing has been "domestic cozy" blogging as a retreat from reality. As Toby says: *For three weeks, I have wondered: how much of what Iâ€™ve thought and written about on this site is even relevant now?* - but Toby concludes there is a way through - urgently and critically through reexamining our core values. Thank you Toby.
