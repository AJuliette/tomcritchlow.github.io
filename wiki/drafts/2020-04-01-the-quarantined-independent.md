For the past few years I've been writing a book, serializing the posts on my blog: [The Strategic Independent](https://tomcritchlow.com/strategy/).

I've always thought of this book as trying to be a "201" level reference - useful for those who already figured out the basics.

It contains things like [how to effectively embed yourself inside client organizations](https://tomcritchlow.com/2017/07/18/the-consultants-grain/), [balancing strategy & execution](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/04/04/the-strategic-independent/), [the theatre of work](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/11/18/yes-and/) etc.

But we're all beginners now. And these topics seem abstract and out of touch with our reality.

So I'm putting the book on pause and launching a new mini-series - a more urgent and hopefully more actionable series[^toby]:

[^toby]: The only blogging I've been doing has been "domestic cozy" blogging as a retreat from reality. As Toby says: *For three weeks, I have wondered: how much of what I’ve thought and written about on this site is even relevant now?* - but Toby concludes there is a way through - urgently and critically through reexamining our core values. Thank you Toby.

## New Blogchain: The Quarantined Independent

The series home will be here: [The Quarantined Independent](https://tomcritchlow.com/blogchains/the-quarantined-independent/). Posts will drop out serially on my blog.

### 2. Mutual Aid for Indies

Now more than ever we need collaboration, cooperation and no one wants the cult of personality in these times.

What follows here is little more than a cleaned up version of our notes. To be sure, these premonitions are based on a certain depth of cultural observation and processing. But premonitions nonetheless. On the other side of this is the unknown. But if you’re already tracking the intangible, you can hit targets others can’t see.</div>

### 3. Start your writing

Writing works like compound interest. Let's be clear - we're not going to blog our way out of the slump but investing in a blogging habit now will pay off next year in spades when the economy gets going again.



### 4. Show the Process

Craig Mod is doing this wonderfully. Nothing braggy or showy. Just showing up and livestreaming the work. Note how the work here is not even client work - but it shows off the range of capabilities wonderfully.
