The challenges of being strategic for remote clients
I’m lucky to be based in NYC and to have most of my clients also be in NYC. This is a luxury and allows me to get context on clients easily.

I did work for a Seattle company for 2.5 years though and a Delaware company for 1.5 years.

There’s two key things you miss out on. Business context and people context.

Both of these are more easily picked up on in-person in the office.

You need to be in the flows to get the context.
Some ways:
Phone calls not video chats
Text messages
C-suite conversations
Unprompted communication (send them mood boards or links)
Get there often! Workshops excuses.
Ask for docs and info.
