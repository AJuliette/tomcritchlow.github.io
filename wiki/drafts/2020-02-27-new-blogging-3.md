Venkatesh just posted a banger:

>There is a renaissance underway in online text as a medium. The Four Horsemen of this emerging Textopia are:
>
>- Roam, a hypertext publishing platform best understood as a medium for composing conspiracy theories and extended universes.
>- Substack, a careful and thorough ground-up neoclassical reconstruction of the age-old email newsletter.
>- Static websites, built out of frameworks like Jekyll or Gatsby (full disclosure: a consulting client).
>- And finally, Threaded Twitter, a user-pioneered hack-turned-supported feature that has wonderfully revitalized the platform.
>I want to take a stab at lightly theorizing this renaissance. And also speculating, in light of this renaissance, about what might be the eighth and penultimate death of blogging. And the future of books. So it’s going to be a sprawling, messy hot take on the State of Textual Media. Or at least a simmering take, since I’ve been thinking about this stuff for a year on the backburner.

Something.
