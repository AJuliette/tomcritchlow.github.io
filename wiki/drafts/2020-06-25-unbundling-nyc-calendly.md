<p><strong>What exactly is the value of being able to take a lot of casual, serendipitous, impromptu meetings with potential clients? And how does this equation change due to the pandemic-related travel freeze, both in the short and long-term?</strong></p><p>I won’t bury the lede: I ran the numbers for my own practice over the last 9 years, and  70.3% of my consulting revenue can be attributed to gigs that started out as casual coffee meetings, while 26.2% closed online.
