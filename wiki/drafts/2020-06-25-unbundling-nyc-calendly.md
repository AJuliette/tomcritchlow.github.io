Venkatesh from ArtofGig is examining his own consulting practice and recently wrote this (subscribers only - I highly recommend subscribing):

<p><strong>What exactly is the value of being able to take a lot of casual, serendipitous, impromptu meetings with potential clients? And how does this equation change due to the pandemic-related travel freeze, both in the short and long-term?</strong></p><p>I won’t bury the lede: I ran the numbers for my own practice over the last 9 years, and  70.3% of my consulting revenue can be attributed to gigs that started out as casual coffee meetings, while 26.2% closed online. Here’s the pie chart (I consolidated 17 small clients with billings under 5k, and amounting to 3.5%, into one small pie slice):</p>

<p>So the headline is crystal clear: <strong>at least my kind of consulting practice is </strong><em><strong>hugely </strong></em><strong>dependent on gigs that start out as casual coffee meetings</strong>.</p>

So I thought I'd take a look at my own stats:

## How Many Clients Come from Random Coffee Meetings

This is a central piece of Venkatesh's data - so let's take a look at my own:

![](/images/chart-coffee.svg)

I'm defining these as:

- Coffee meeting: Where the initial point of contact with the client was a somewhat unscripted coffee meeting.
- In-person: This is where the initial meeting was in-person but with more of an agenda, i.e. a meeting at the client's office.
- Digital: This is where the whole sales funnel happened without meeting in person
- Other: These are assorted clients, mostly clients I already know where the deal happened without any kind of "sales"

## Where do Clients Come From?

As interesting as *how* I met clients is *why* I met them. Let's examine where clients come from:

I'm defining these as:

- Out of Network: A cold email, linkedin message or other inbound contact unconnected to my network
