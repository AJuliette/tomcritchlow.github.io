What is the best way to build and sustain growth for your company? This is a problem that requires careful thinking, iterative design and strong leadership.

My work is focused on helping companies understand growth & how it relates to their users, their product and their teams. I have experience building and leading teams, working on big projects in-house and consulting for startups and Fortune 500s.

##My Best Work is On-Site

I like to be embedded within teams so I can bring you pastries and smell the fires. Embedded systems reduce friction, make communication quicker and ultimately make projects succeed. By sitting with you and your teams I can help do the work and embed knowledge and abilities to ensure that your team is set up to succeed without me in the long run.

I'm based in New York City (Brooklyn to be precise), but available to travel for work.
