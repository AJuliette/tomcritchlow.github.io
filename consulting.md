What is the best way to build and sustain growth for your company? This is a problem that requires careful thinking, iterative design and ultimately strong leadership.

My work is focused on helping companies understand growth & how it relates to their users, their product and their teams. I have experience building and leading teams, working on big projects in-house and consulting for startups and Fortune 500s.

## The Modern Marketing Team

The days of a few copywriters and marketing managers is long gone. You should be building a team that is multi-disciplinary and has engineering, design and product talent on it. This is the team I'm used to working with and the team that builds the best results.


##My Best Work is On-Site

I like to be embedded within teams so I can bring you pastries and smell the fires. Embedded systems reduce friction, make communication quicker and ultimatley make projects succeed. I'm based in New York City (Brooklyn to be precise), but available to travel for work.
